## Chapter 2 

The  actual  process  is  quite  simple:  laying  out  a  project  only entails  creating  a  few  directories  with  mkdir  and  empty  README  files  with  touch(commands we’ll see in more depth later). But this simple initial planning pays off inthe long term.

In these cases, it’s important to always use relative paths (e.g., ../data/stats/qual.txt). Using absolute paths leaves your work less portable between collaborators and decreases reproducibility.

- Document your methods and workflows

This should include full command lines (copied and pasted) that are run throughthe  shell  that  generate  data  or  intermediate  results.

--> I never do that, shame on me

- Document the origin of all data in your project directory

You need to keep track of where data was downloaded from, who gave it to you,and  any  other  relevant  information. It’s  important  to  include  when  the  data  was  downloaded.

- Document the versions of the software that you ran

All of this information is best stored in plain-text README files. 
Where  should  you  keep  your  README  files?  A  good  approach  is  to  keep  READMEfiles in each of your project’s main directories.

Ultimately,  you’ll  arrive  at  your  own  project  organization  system  thatworks for you; the take-home point is: leverage directories to help stay organized.

### Shell Expansion Tips

 If you’ve ever typed cd ~ togo  to  your  home  directory,  you’ve  used  shell  expansion—it’s  yourshell  that  expands  the  tilde  character  (~)

 $ mkdir -p zmays-snps/{data/seqs,scripts,analysis}

 it’s best to be as restrictive as possible when using wildcards. Instead of zmaysB*,use zmaysB*fastq or zmaysB_R?.fastq (the ? only matches a single character).

 Another useful trick is to use leading zeros (e.g., file-0021.txt ratherthan  file-21.txt)  when  naming  files.

--> Malandragem

### Markdown for Project Notebooks

Plain text is alsoa   future-proof  format:  plain-text  files  written  in  the  1960s  are  still  readable  today,whereas files from word processors only 10 years old can be difficult or impossible toopen  and  edit. 

Pandoc can convert between a variety of different markup and output formats. UsingPandoc  is  very  simple—to  convert  from  Markdown  to  HTML,  use  the  --from markdown and --to html options and supply your input file as the last argument:$ pandoc --from markdown --to html notebook.md > output.html


## Chapter 3

--> Pergunta: Qual a primeira vez que vcs se sentiram impressionados com o poder do shell?

The  Unix  shell  provides  a  way  for  these  programs  to  talk  to  each  other  (pipes)  andwrite to and read files (redirection).
We’ll address Unix streams in this chapter, but the conceptof  a  stream  is  very  important  in  how  we  process  large  data.
If   I   needed   to   search   for   the   exact   string   “GTGAT‐TAACTGCGAA”  in  this  data,  I  couldn’t  open  up  a  lane  of  data  in  Notepad  and  usethe  Find  feature  to  pinpoint  where  it  occurs—there  simply  isn’t  enough  memory  tohold  all  these  nucleotides  in  memory.  Instead,  tools  must  rely  on  streams  of  data,being  read  from  a  source  and  actively  processed.

make sure you’re using the Bourne-again shell,  or  bash.

--> The z shell is cooler though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell

In  mydaily  bioinformatics  work,  I  use  Z  shell  (zsh)

--> Noice

Unix  was  not  designed  to  stop  its  users  from  doing  stupid  things,  as  that  would  alsostop them from doing clever things.
—Doug Gwyn

--> This is a very generalizable principle. It is the basis of Wiki, in a sense. 

Additionally,  pasting  contents  into  a  file  doesn’t  follow  a  recommendation  fromChapter 1: treat data as read-only.

wecan  combine  large  files  by  printing  their  contents  to  the  standard  output  stream and redirect this stream from our terminal to the file we wish to save the combined resultsto.

We  use  the  operators  >  or  >>  to  redirect  standard  output  to  a  file.  The  operator  >redirects  standard  output  to  a  file  and  overwrites  any  existing  contents  of  the  file(take  note  of  this  and  be  careful),  whereas  the  latter  operator  >>  appends  to  the  file(keeping  the  contents  and  just  adding  to  the  end).

lrt  to  the  ls  lists  files  in  this  directory  in  list  format  (-l),  in  reverse  (-r)time  (-t)  order

Like standardoutput,  standard  error  is  by  default  directed  to  your  terminal.  In  practice,  we  oftenwant to redirect the standard error stream to a file so messages, errors, and warningsare logged to a file we can check later.

standard error stream, 2>

--> Cool, did not know that

Unix-like  operating  systems  have  a  special  “fake”  disk(known as a pseudodevice) to redirect unwanted output to: /dev/null. Output writtento  /dev/null  disappears,  which  is  why  it’s  sometimes  jokingly  referred  to  as  a  “black‐hole” by nerds.

It’s a bit more common to use Unix pipes (e.g., cat inputfile | program > outputfile) than <

We  use  pipes  in  bioinformatics  (quite  compulsively)not only because they are useful way of building pipelines, but because they’re faster(in  some  cases,  much  faster).

The Golden Rule of Bioinformatics is to not trust your tools or data. This skepticismrequires  constant  sanity  checking  of  intermediate  results,  which  ensures  your  meth‐ods  aren’t  biasing  your  data,  or  problems  in  your  data  aren’t  being  exacerbated  byyour methods

invert  the  matching  lines  with  the  grep  option  -v.

 Whenused in brackets, a caret symbol matches anything that’s not one of the charactersin these brackets. So the pattern [^ATCG] matches any character that’s not A, T, C,or  G.  Also,  we  ignore  case  with  -i,  because  a,  t,  c,  and  g  are  valid  nucleotides(lowercase characters are often used to indicate masked repeat or low-complexitysequences).  Finally,  we  add  grep’s  --color  option  to  color  the  matching  non-nucleotide characters

 --> cool

 Most bioinformaticians have made this mistake at somepoint and learned the hard way (by losing the FASTA file they were hoping to grep),so beware.

 --> Dang that sucks

 backslash  is  used  to  split  these  commandsacross multiple lines to improve readability (and is optional in your own work).Meanwhile,  program2  uses  the  standard  output  from  program1  as  its  standa

 --> I underuse that

 Theoperator is what redirects standard error to the standard output stream.

  Like  aplumber’s  T  joint,  the  Unix  program  tee  diverts  a  copy  of  your  pipeline’s  standardoutput  stream  to  an  intermediate  file  while  still  passing  it  through  its  standard  out‐put:$ program1 input.txt | tee intermediate-file.txt | program2 > results.txt

  --> Also super cool.

  We  can  tell  the  Unix  shell  to  run  a  program  in  the  background  by  appending  anampersand (&) to the end of our command

  --> rstudio . & saves lives

e can suspend processes by sending a stopsignal  through  the  key  combination  Control-z hen  use  the  bg  com‐mand  to  run  it  in  the  background. 

 If the process is currently runningin your shell, you can kill it by entering Control-C

y  Unix  standards,  an  exit  status  of  0  indicates  the  process  ran  successfully,  and  anynonzero status indicates some sort of error has occurred (and hopefully the programprints an understandable error message, too).

--> Learned that on CS50

The exit status isn’t printed to the terminal, but your shell will set its value to a vari‐able in your shell (aptly named a shell variable) named $?
completed successfully (&&), and one operator that runs the next command only if thefirst  completed  unsuccessfully  (||)


command  substitution.  Commandsubstitution runs a Unix command inline and returns the output as a string that canbe used in another command.

Using  this  command  substitution  approach,  we  can  easily  create  dated  directories
$ mkdir results-$(date +%F)$
$ ls results-2015-04-13

hen results are sorted by name, directories in this format also sort chrono‐logically

The cleverness behind this is what makes this date format, known as ISO 8601, useful.

A  word  of  warning,  though:  do  not  use  your  aliased  command  inproject-level  shell  scripts!  These  reside  in  your  shell’s  startup  file(e.g., ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc), which is outside of your project directory.



## Chapter 4
 We  use  SSH  because  it’s  encrypted(which makes it secure to send passwords, edit private files, etc.), and because it’s onevery  Unix  system.

The  material  covered  in  this  section  should  helpyou answer common SSH questions a sysadmin may ask (e.g., “Do you have an SSHpublic  key?”).  You’ll  also  learn  all  of  the  basics  you’ll  need  as  a  bioinformatician  toSSH into remote machines

--> Nice!

ssh biocluster.myuniversity.edu

SH also works with IP addresses—for example, you could connect to a machine withssh 192.169.237.42.  If  your  server  uses  a  different  port  than  the  default  (port  22),or  your  username  on  the  remote  machine  is  different  from  your  local  username,you’ll need to specify these details when connecting:$

 ssh -p 50453 cdarwin@biocluster.myuniversity.edu

the SSH configfile.  SSH  config  files  store  details  about  hosts  you  frequently  connect to.

 ~/.ssh/config.
 Eachentry takes the following form:
 Host bio_serv     
 HostName 192.168.237.42     
 User cdarwin     
 Port 50453

 You  won’t  need  to  specify  Port  and  User  unless  these  differ  fromthe  remote  host’s  defaults.
 With  this  file  saved,  you  can  SSH  into192.168.236.42 using the alias ssh bio_serv.

 --> Nooice

 $ hostname
 biocluster.myuniversity.edu

$ whoami
cdarwin

A safer, easier alternative is to use anSSH public key. Public key cryptography is a fascinating technology, but the details areoutside  the  scope  of  this  book. 

--> Love that he leaves the details out (no kidding).

enerate  a  public/private  key  pair.  We  do  thiswith  the  command  ssh-keygen.  It’s  very  important  that  you  note  the  differencebetween  your  public  and  private  keys:  you  can  distribute  your  public  key  to  otherservers, but your private key must be kept safe and secure and never shared

$ ssh-keygen -b 2048

This  creates  a  private  key  at  ~/.ssh/id_rsa  and  a  public  key  at  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

To  use  password-less  authentication  using  SSH  keys,  first  SSH  to  your  remote  hostand log in with your password. Change directories to ~/.ssh, and append the contentsof  your  public  key  file  (id_rsa.pub,  not  your  private  key!)  to  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.

After  you’ve  added  your  public  key  to  the  remote  host,  try  logging  in  a  few  times.You’ll  notice  that  you  keep  getting  prompted  for  your  SSH  key’s  password.  If  you’rescratching your head wondering how this saves time, there’s one more trick to know:ssh-agent.  SSH agent is usually already running on Unix-based systems, but if not, youcan use eval ssh-agent to start it.

if our network connection tem‐porarily  drops  out.  This  behavior  is  intentional—your  program  will  receive  thehangup signal (referred to more technically as SIGHUP), which will in almost all casescause  your  application  to  exit  immediately.

nohup and Tmux. If you use a cluster, there are better ways to deal with hangups (e.g.,submitting  batch  jobs  to  your  cluster’s  software),  but  these  depend  on  your  specificcluster configuration. In this case, consult your system administrator

--> Who uses other systems, like HPC systems?

nohup program1 > output.txt & [1] 10900 We run the command with all options and arguments as we would normally, butby  adding  nohup  this  program  will  not  be  interrupted  if  your  terminal  were  toclose  or  the  remote  connection  were  to  drop.  Additionally,  it’s  a  good  idea  toredirect  standard  output  and  standard  error  just  as  we  did  in  Chapter  3  so  youcan check output later.

Tmux (and terminal multiplexers in general) allow you to create a session containingmultiple  windows,  each  capable  of  running  their  own  processes.  Tmux’s  sessions  arepersistent,  meaning  that  all  windows  and  their  processes  can  easily  be  restored  byreattaching the session.

I  strongly  suggest  you  go  to  this  chapter’s  directory  on  GitHub  anddownload the .tmux.conf file to your home directory.

--> Cool

tmux new-session -s maize-snps

--> I use this so much that I've aliased it to "tt"



## Chapter 5

you    may    have    files    with    names    such    as    thesis-vers1.docx,    thesis-vers3_CD_edits.docx,    analysis-vers6.R
However,  this  ad  hoc  file  versioning  systemdoesn’t scale well to complicated bioinformatics project

I highly recommend you take the timeto learn Git in this chapter, but be aware that understanding Git (like most topics inthis  book,  and  arguably  everything  in  life)  will  take  time  and  practice

Why learn‐ing Git is definitely worth the effort.

--> Nice that he took the time to outline that 

* Git Allows You to Keep Snapshots of Your Project

--> Narrative example is very useful

A good analogy comes from my friend and colleagueMike Covington: imagine you keep a lab notebook in pencil, and each time you run anew PCR you erase your past results and jot down the newest ones. This may soundextreme, but is functionally no different than changing code and not keeping a recordof past versions.

* Git Helps You Keep Track of Important Changes to Code
The  bioinformatician  quickly  emails  everyone  in  his  lab  the  new  ver‐sion and warns them of the potential for incorrect results. Unfortunately, members ofthe other lab may not get the message and could continue using the older buggy ver‐sion of the script.

git init creates a hidden directory called .git/ in your zmays-snps/ project directory(you  can  see  it  with  ls -a).  This  .git/  directory  is  how  Git  manages  your  repositorybehind  the  scenes.

--> Esse detalhe é crucial

Although you’ve initialized the zmays-snps/ as a Git repository, Git doesn’t automati‐cally begin tracking every file in this directory. Rather, you need to tell Git which filesto track using the subcommand git add. 

 This  extra  step  may  seem  like  an  inconvenience  but  actually  has  many  benefits.

 git commit: Taking a Snapshot of Your Project
 
 Optionally, you can omitthe  -m  option,  and  Git  will  open  up  your  default  text  editor.  If  you  prefer  to  writecommit  messages  in  a  text  editor  (useful  if  they  are  multiline  messages),  you  canchange the default editor Git uses with:
 $ git config --global core.editor emacs
 
 where  emacs  can  be  replaced  by  vim  (the  default)  or  another  text  editor  of  yourchoice.

 --> https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
 --> https://dev.to/helderburato/patterns-for-writing-better-git-commit-messages-4ba0

   Another  subcom‐mand is quite helpful in this process: git diff.Without any arguments, git diff shows you the difference between the files in yourworking directory and what’s been staged.

   --> I use it less than I should

   git log  opens  up  your  repository’s  history  in  your  default  pager(usually either the program more or less). If you’re unfamiliar withpagers,  less,  and  more,  don’t  fret.  To  exit  and  get  back  to  yourprompt,  hit  the  letter  q.

     Tomove or remove tracked files in Git, we need to use Git’s version of mv and rm: git mvand git rm

  --> Wow, I did not know that.

  These  should  be  ignored  and  managed  by  other  means,  as  Git  isn’t  designed  tomanage really large files.

  --> dvc.org is a super good work around

  ext editor temporary filesText  editors  like  Emacs  and  Vim  will  sometimes  create  temporary  files  in  yourdirectory.  These  can  look  like  textfile.txt~  or  #textfile.txt#.  There’s  no  point  instoring  these  in  Git,  and  they  can  be  an  annoyance  when  viewing  progress  withgit status.  These  files  should  always  be  added  to  .gitignore.  Luckily,  .gitignoretakes wildcards, so these can be ignored with entries like *~ and \#*\#

  --> Cool

Merge conflicts seem scary, but the strategy to solve them isalways the same:
1.Use git status to find the conflicting file(s).
2.Open and edit those files manually to a version that fixes the conflict.
3.Use git add to tell Git that you’ve resolved the conflict in a particular file.
4.Once  all  conflicts  are  resolved,  use  git  status  to  check  that  all  changes  arestaged

By default, git checkout restores the file version from HEAD. However, git checkoutcan restore any arbitrary version from commit history.

One  very  useful  Git  subcommand  is  git stash,  which  saves  any  working  changesyou’ve  made  since  the  last  commit  and  restores  your  repository  to  the  version  atHEAD.  You  can  then  reapply  these  saved  changes  later.  git stash  is  handy  when  wewant  to  save  our  messy,  partial  progress  before  operations  that  are  best  performedwith  a  clean  working  directory—for  example,  git  pull  or  branching  (more  onbranching later).

--> I almost never use that

One  use  for  git diff  is  to  compare  the  difference  between  two  arbitrary  commits.

The  caret  notation  (^)  represents  the  parent  commit  of  a  commit.  For  example,  torefer to the parent of the most recent commit on the current branch (HEAD), we’d useHEAD^. HEAD^^ is the same as HEAD~2

--> Cool, I did not know that

 Git also has a tool called git bisect to help devel‐opers find where exactly bugs entered their commit history. git bisect is out of thescope of this chapter, but there are some good examples in git bisect --help

 git commit --amend opens up your last commit message in your default text editor,allowing you to edit it. 

 git fetch doesn’t change any of your local branches; rather, it just synchronizes yourremote branches with the newest commits from the remote repositories. 

  After  you’ve  mastered  all  of  these  concepts,  youmay  want  to  move  on  to  more  advanced  Git  topics  such  as  rebasing  (git rebase),searching  revisions  (git grep),  and  submodules.  However,  none  of  these  topics  arerequired in daily Git use; you can search out and learn these topics as you need them.A  great  resource  for  these  advanced  topics  is  Scott  Chacon  and  Ben  Straub’s  Pro  Gitbook.

  --> Hmm, seem useful, though
