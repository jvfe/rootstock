notes/Q83224730.md:Importantly, non-proliferative interstitial cytotrophoblasts (npiCTB) were identified for the first time in the placental villi as forming a distinct cluster. This new cluster was also observed in the basal plate, but not in the chorioamniotic membranes, suggesting that this type of trophoblast has specific functions in the placental tree. The non-proliferative nature of npiCTBs was evidenced by the reduced expression of genes involved in cell proliferation such as XIST, DDX3X, and EIF1AX.

notes/Q73867340.md:. Des cellules souches d’origine endodermique répondant aux critères énoncés ci-dessus existent dans le pancréas pendant la vie embryonnaire; ces cellules expriment le facteur de transcription Pdx1, et l’on observe un défaut de développement global du pancréas lorsque Pdx1 est absent, chez la souris comme chez l’être humain [2,3]. Une étude récente confirme, en utilisant des approches de traçage, que toutes les cellules matures du pancréas ont exprimé Pdx1 à un moment de leur développement
notes/Q73867340.md: La localisation d’éventuelles cellules souches pancréatiques est également controversée: pendant longtemps, le dogme voulait que ces cellules souches soient situées dans les canaux pancréatiques [15], mais on pense plutôt que les cellules souches pancréatiques (au moins celles qui donnent naissances aux cellules endocrines) seraient localisées au sein des îlots de Langerhans chez l’adulte [16].

notes/Q94522302.md:In UniProtKB, a single article can be annotated for many proteins, sometimes with the same class; hence, the prediction results are not independent, biasing the assessment. We tried to mitigate this issue by creating a test set with unique ‘document → categories’ pairs; however, examples in this set still cannot be considered as fully independent, as one document can be associated with class sub-sets, e.g. PMID → [Function] and PMID → [Function, Sequences].
notes/Q24678240.md:If genes linked by disorder associa- tions encode proteins that interact in functionally distinguishable modules, then the proteins within such disease modules should more likely interact with one another than with other proteins. To test this hypothesis, we overlaid the DGN on a network of physical protein–protein interactions derived from high-quality systematic interactome mapping (6, 7) and literature curation (6). We found that 290 interactions overlap between the two networks, a 10-fold increase relative to random expectation (P ⬍ 10⫺6;Fig.3a).

notes/Q106369750.md:The development of this case study was divided into threesteps.  In  the  first  step,  one  of  the  authors  of  the  originalstudy  formulated  a  set  of  questions  of  interest  that  shouldbe  answered  through  our  reproduction  study.  Examples  ofthese questions include:•How many genes were upregulated and downregulatedin mesenchymal stromal cells from patients with Type-1  Diabetes  (T1D-MSCs)  compared  with  those  fromhealthy individuals (C-MSCs)?•Is theCXCL12gene upregulated inT1D-MSCscom-pared to theC-MSCs? What other genes have expres-sion profile similar to theCXCL12gene?In the second step, we created a set of four workflows toanswer the posed questions. Figure 3 illustrates the workflowcreated for the differential analysis study.

notes/Q105870481.md:Abstract.—Current controversies  about the  definitions  of  taxon names reflect  different  under-lying philosophical  perspectives concerning the nature  of definitions.  The antithetical  perspec-tives,  called  methodological  essentialism  and  methodological  nominalism  (Popper,  1966, Theopen society and its enemies, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, NJ), are exemplified by alternativeviews  in  a  controversy  surrounding  the  definition  of  the  name  "Mammalia."  Traditional  per-spectives on the definition  of "Mammalia" are essentialistic in that the definition  takes the  formof a description  stated in terms  of the traits  of individual organisms, thus implying that taxa areabstract  categories,  i.e., that  taxa  have  essence.s.  In  addition, the  extension  of  the  defined  term(the set  of  species or organisms to which  the name applies)  is logically prior  to its intension  ordefining formula (the property or properties that a species or organism must have to be designatedby  the  name). Consequently,  the  name  is treated  as  if  it  had  a designation  proper  to it,  whichconforms with the essentialistic view that the name is an abbreviated description  of the essence.An alternative  perspective  is manifested  in  the  redefinition  of  "Mammalia" as the  name  of  themonotreme and therian  crown clade. This perspective  contrasts with the traditional one in  thatthe definition  is stated in terms  of common  ancestry relationships rather than organismal traits,thus implying that taxa are concrete composite wholes rather than abstract categories. In addition,the defining  formula  is logically prior  to the  extension  of the  defined  term, and  thus the  nameis treated  only  as a convenient  label or shorthand  symbol  for  the  defining  formula  that  has noproper designation. The replacement  of an essentialistic perspective on the definitions  of "Mam-malia" and  other  taxon  names  by  a  more  nominalistic  one  is associated with  the  developmentof  a phylogenetic  perspective  on  biological  nomenclature  and  represents  an  important  step  inthe development  of a more broadly  scientific approach  to that subject. [Definition;  essentialism;nominalism; Mammalia; nomenclature; philosophy; taxonomy; Karl  R. Popper.]
notes/Q105870481.md:According  to  Popper,a  definition,  as it  is normally  used  in  modern science,must be read from  back to front,  or from  the right to  theleft; for  it  starts  with  the  defining  formula,  andasks for  a short  label  to it. Thus the scientific  viewof the definition  "A puppy  is a young dog" wouldbe that  it  is an  answer  to the  question  "What  shallwe call a young dog?" rather  than  an answer to thequestion  "What  is a  puppy?"  (Popper,  1966[2]:14,emphasis  in  original)
notes/Q105870481.md: Popper  (1966[2]:9) held  the  view  thatevery discipline,  as long as it used the  Aristotelianmethod  of  definition,  has  remained  arrested  in  astate  of  empty  verbiage  and  barren  scholasticism,and  . . . the  degree  to  which  the  various  scienceshave  been  able  to  make  any  progress  [has]  de-pended  on  the  degree  to  which  they  have  beenable  to  get  rid  of  this  essentialist  method
notes/Q105870481.md:To  answer  the  question  'What  are  mam-mals?' we still must identify  diagnostic  fea-tures." Only by confusing  definitions  withdiagnoses  is  Miao  able  to  criticize  a  defi-nition  for  not doing the job  of a diagnosis.Confusions  of  this  kind  are  not  surpris-ing  under  an  essentialistic  interpretationof  definitions. 
notes/Q105870481.md:Perhaps  because  certain  fossils  compro-mised  the  distinctiveness  of  the  mamma-lian  jaw  articulation,  some  recent  defini-tions   of   "Mammalia"   have   emphasizeddifferent characters. But here again, the  def-initions  rest  on  prior  establishment  of  themammalian   status   of   particular   fossils.These  cases also demonstrate  that  a meth-odologically  essentialistic  perspective  canbe adopted even when definitions  are stat-ed in  terms  of phylogenetic  relationships
notes/Q105870481.md:Taxonomists  have  traditional-ly viewed their definitions  of  "Mammalia"as answers to the question "What are mam-mals?"  Thus,  this  very  question  (or  thevariant  "What  is  a  mammal?")  has  beenstated explicitly by at least six different  au-thors  in  connection  with  traditional  defi-nitions of "Mammalia" (Olson, 1959; Simp-son, 1959; Reed, 1960; Aulie, 1975; Thenius,1979; Miao, 1991).
notes/Q105870481.md:tive, advocates  of  thecrown  clade  definition  of  "Mammalia"  donot  view  their  definition  as  an  answer  tothe question "What are mammals?" or even"What  is the  meaning  of  the  name  'Mam-malia'?"  Instead,  the  crown  clade  defini-tion is meant to answer the question "Whatshall we  call the  clade stemming  from  themost  recent  common  ancestor   of  mono-tremes  and  therians?"  This  interpretationof  the  definition  is  ev

De-spite  the  considerable  advances  that  tax-onomy   has  undergone   since   Aristotle'stime,  the  influence  of  the  Greek  philoso-pher  is  still  felt  in  a widespread  perspec-tive  on  the  nature   of  taxonomic   defini-tions—a perspective considered by Popper(1966)  to  be  extremely  detrimental  to  sci-entific  progress. 
notes/Q29617753.md:Only two cells expressing EGFP were detected in serial sections of a whole Gscl BAC transgenic embryo. These cells are present in the ventricular zone at the border of the developing mesencephalon and metencephalon, as expected from visualization of the expanding IPN progenitor pool in E15.5 embryos. These results suggest that Gscl is a lineage marker for a specific class of neurons that arise in the ventricular zone at E10.5, establish a progenitor pool that is still differentiating and migrating into the presumptive IPN at E15.5
notes/Q29617753.md:The identifi- cation of Gscl expression in a small population of neurons in the IPN suggests a functional role for Gscl that has not been tested in any of the studies done to assess the consequences of loss of Gscl function in vivo. For example, loss of this small cell population as a consequence of Gscl deletion would be missed unless specific markers that identify this cell type were examined in the knockout animals.
notes/Q29617753.md:Sema3b marked the projection neurons from the pontine nucleus, the vestibular nucleus and the spinocerebellar tract (Fig. 3a).

notes/Q29617753.md:By P7, Pde1c-expressing cells persisted in layer 1 ofthe cortex, suggesting they are the SGL cell population because these cells persist longer than pioneer neurons, which are thought to disappear by birth.

However,  the  final  atlas  is  created  from  a  combination of datasets, which requires that the technologies used be  compatible.  To  assess  how  suitable  it  is  to  combine  the  results  from  our  protocols  into  a  joint  analysis,  we  used  down-sampled  human and mouse datasets to produce a joint quantification matrix for all techniques25. Importantly, single cells grouped themselves by cell type, suggesting that cell phenotypes are the main driver of het-erogeneity  in  the  joint  datasets  (Fig.  5a–d,  and  see  Supplementary  Figs. 19a,b and 20). Indeed, the combined data showed a clear sepa-ration of cell states (for example, T cell and enterocyte subpopula-tions) and rarer cell types, such as dendritic cells

notes/Q33261434.md:Our analysis offive important bacterial groups suggests, however, that more stringent standards for species may be justifiable when a solid understanding of gene content and ecological distinctiveness becomes available
notes/Q33261434.md:the 70% DDH criterion is quite valuable as a first standard approximation for species since it encom- passes relatively homogeneous sets of strains which share at least 80% of their genes with a function other than hypothetical or mobile. The question then becomes whether the up to 20% difference in genes with well-recognizable functions is a large enough difference to justify description of further taxonomic subdivisions (more species?) within species.
notes/Q33261434.md:Precisely how large a difference in gene content has to be present between two strains before they could be described as separate species, however, would always be an ambiguous question, particularly if the strains were not separated by a substantial genetic distance.

notes/Q27021885.md:--> Interesting lexical jump from "interneurons of different subtypes" to "interneuron subtypes".
notes/Q27021885.md:The observations that genetically defined interneuron classes show similar recruitment suggests they do act as functional units, supporting the existence of a small number of cardinal interneuron types.
notes/Q27021885.md:In this Review, we suggest that the large diversity in interneuron classes may originate from a handful of cardinal cell types. Such an assertion could be misinterpreted as a statement claiming that interneuron classes are not diverse or that divisions into further subtypes are not warranted. The incredible work in areas such as the hippocampus shows us that this is patently incorrect. We have provided a framework that we hope will help to direct future studies by consolidating interneuron diversity into cardinal classes with specific ground states.
notes/Q27021885.md:In short, we may ultimately find that interneurons exist as cardinal classes because nature has conspired to bestow on them generalized computational function that necessitated the presence of common biophysical and hodological properties. Despite these commonalities, it is self-evident that neural circuits allow for a remarkable array of behavioural outcomes. Harnessing biology’s ability to use a limited set of building blocks, to cre- ate enormous diversity circuits holds the real promise that we may soon begin to understand the means by which brain circuits self-assemble and initiate function.

notes/Q104684648.md:Intravascular cell labeling,cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that classical CD14+blood monocytes derivedfrom HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages.

Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing defined intermedi-ate differentiation stages in human lung macrophage development from blood monocytes. This study iden-tifies distinct developmental pathways from circulating monocytes to lung macrophages and reveals howcellular origin contributes to human macrophage identity, diversity, and localizationin vivo.

The first is to grind through it wasting a lot of time; the second is to put the response through a filter, but these can be hard to program and risk being over-specific; the third and best is to use our existing knowledge formalised in ontologies to refine the question so that we get the answer we want (with perhaps a few false positives).

notes/Q28646342.md:BIOASQassesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles, and to returnconcise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information frombiomedical articles and ontologies.
notes/Q28646342.md:The 2013 BIOASQ competition comprised two tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were askedto automatically annotate new PUBMEDdocuments with MESH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a, with atotal of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used byNLM to suggest MESH headings to curators.
notes/Q28646342.md:Semantic indexing, i.e., annotating documents withconcepts from established semantic taxonomies or, moregenerally, ontologies, provides a means to combine multi-ple sources and facilitates matching questions to answers.In recent years, many methods have been developed thatutilize existing ontology structures and concepts to indexdocuments and perform semantic search [5]
notes/Q28646342.md:Theretrieved information is then turned into a concise, user-understandable form, which may be, for example, a rankedlist of candidate answers (e.g., in factoid questions, like“What are the physiological manifestations of disorder Y?”)

notes/Q74657187.md:--> One of the underlying assumptions. Taken literally, it seems almost self-evident that there is _some_ system of similarities, because that is one of the basis of human rational thinking. There is a meta-scientific aspect to it also, and we profit from classifying what people in general _think_ that exist. Especify and reconcile different conceptualizations, explicip and implicit ones. Sometimes they are even methodologically implicit: the conceptualization is permanently embedded in the methods, in a logical lock that restricts the domain for which claims are valid.
notes/Q74657187.md:To indicate the range of variability, we will add ‘tests I, J, K, L variable in both species ’. A common complaint is that generic definitions contain features qualified by the word ‘usually’. There is some substance in such complaints, since this implies that the features listed are not well correlated, but from the theoretical point of view, every feature must be so qualified. If enough well- correlated features are used, the description will be adequate.
notes/Q74657187.md:Single-feature keys are pernicious since they suggest that the group can be
notes/Q74657187.md:It is best to use one temperature for both species, for the risk of all our tests being vitiated seems less than the risk of making our work unrepeat- able. Cowan (1956~) recently made a forceful plea for standardization of descriptions and reform of nomenclature.

notes/Q74657187.md:We see a pattern which suggests we have ‘ hit the jackpot ’ ! Is this pattern due to chance? We might have chosen strains and tests which by chance gave the pattern we see. 
notes/Q74657187.md:The best method of showing one’s results is to publish the full table of all the results with every strain, Editors, wishing to save spdce, will object to this; they should be resisted if possible, for if we condense our table we may lose vital information-literally vital in the sense that our classification will live or die by the information we retain. 
notes/Q74657187.md:Adanson seems to me to have been right, for the concept of ‘ importance ’ seems to play little part in the concept of ‘ greatest content of information.’ The viewpoint of Gilmour (1940) is close to that of Adanson. Gilmour, on epistemological grounds, reaches the same conclusion as is reached here, that the ideal classification is the one with the greatest predictive value.
notes/Q74657187.md:based on correlated features (all qualified by the word usually); he just wants a test to identify a pathogenic bacterium. But, if there is no correlation be- tween pathogenicity and any other feature, it simply means that no such test is known. No re-arrangement of the taxonomy will help him, and if he groups all pathogenic strains into one species, this species means no more than ‘pathogenic strains of genus A’. Is it heretical to suggest that it is simpler to say this rather than to use a Latin name?
notes/Q26770736.md:The question then becomes; how do you really know whether two cells are the same ‘‘type’’? If appearance is not the answer, what is?
notes/Q26770736.md:single-cell RNAseq for cell type identification is the question of how gene expression correlates with function, especially given the need to define cell types increasingly by function
notes/Q26770736.md:Additional problems arise when a researcher is using RNAseq to prove that a cell type in vitro is sufficiently similar to an in vivo cell type to perform functional tests, and even more so when the in vivo cell type is not readily available, such as in the case of human neuronal cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells
notes/Q26770736.md:--> Interesting, I really need to talk more to her
notes/Q26770736.md:We have suggested that a ‘‘cell type’’ could now be defined as a group of cells that possess similar, though not identical, functional properties, variable within a spectrum of epigenetic adjustments that, most importantly, permit its biologically adaptive developmental path, resulting in a functionally equivalent class of cells, to be achieved.
notes/Q37629171.md:While these features all describe the same underlying cells, each investigator typically measures one or several features at a time, creating difficulties linking work across different labora- tories, which is compounded by inconsistent nomencla- ture conventions for these features.
notes/Q104371272.md:For instance, in CD4 cells, the markers had non-zero counts in anywhere from 0% to 38% of the cells. As a result, many marker genes that have been established as reliable indicators of cell-type on the bulk level are no longer adequate on the single cell level.
notes/Q104371272.md:Naive Bayes defines a conditional distribution for each target cell by estimating a cell-type-specific expression rate for each gene
notes/Q104371272.md:"These findings suggest that the identity assigned to a given cell depends on the size of the dataset, in a way that is not representative of the actual cell-types in the data."
notes/Q104371272.md:Specifically, we selected marker genes for CD4 (IL7R, CD4, CTLA4, FOXP3, IL2RA, PTPRC), CD14 (CD14, LYZ, FCGR3A, CD68, S100A12), CD8 (CD8A, CRTAM, NCR3, CD3D), and NK cells (GNLY, NKG7, PRR5L, S1PR5, NCAM1) that have been curated and well-established in the literature as discriminating among cell types. 
notes/Q104371272.md:Interesting. We want to study the cell types themselves, not the cells per se. 
notes/Q34020397.md:the question as to whether such interconversions occur physiologically or in the context of disease. Arguably, gastrulation provides a first example oftransdetermination, where an invaginationofthe ectoderm produces mesoderm.
notes/Q34020397.md:Within the landscape/attractor-based conceptual framework, it is easy to see how cell fate transitions, such as those exhibited by lineage reprogramming events, may be favoured between cell types closely connected through shared regulatory switches. It also predicts that the efficiency by which transcription factors induce lineage conversions depends on the proximity of the cell type in question and that bridging greater distances may require additional factors acting at earlier common branch points
notes/Q34020397.md:This suggests that PRDM16 controls a bidirectional fate switch between skeletal myoblasts and brown fat cells. Other examples include the conversion of astrocytes into neurons70
notes/Q34020397.md:The question then arises whether, given enough knowledge, it will be possible to directly reprogram any cell type into another and to custom-design cells for regenerative therapy from easily obtainable cell sources. Consider B cells for example: we know that transcription factor gain or loss of function can convert these cells into macro- phages as well as into T cells and ES cells. But can B cells be induced directly to become, say, haematopoietic stem cells or islet b-cells at high frequencies, effecting ‘long jumps’ within the landscape of Fig. 5?
notes/Q29547320.md:The similarity within cell types is in contrast to the large differ- ences found between astrocytes, neurons, and OLs. Interestingly, the correlation between pairwise comparisons of astrocytes and OLs is not any stronger than the pairwise correlation ofeither of these cell types with neurons. Considering the highly specialized functions ofeach ofthese mature CNS cell types, it should not be unexpected that their gene expression profiles are highly diver- gent and that each represents an equally unique cell type.
notes/Q29547320.md:Although our data does not address the question ofa com- mon lineage of astrocytes and OLs, these data indicate that ma- ture astrocytes and OLs do not share a large cohort of common “glial” genes, and suggests that the notion of a molecularly de- fined glial cell type is largely misleading because all three mature cell types differ vastly based on the genes that they express.
notes/Q29547320.md:The top 40 astrocyte, neuron, and OL cell-type-specific genes are shown in the heat map in Figure 3, and the top 250 genes appear in supplemental Figure S3 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). As expected, the top 40 cell-type-specific genes include well established cell type specific markers, verifying our isolation procedure.
notes/Q29547320.md:The ABA informatics filter identifies genes with similar spatial distribution patterns. Training these filters with the ISH pattern for established cell-type-specific markers was used to pre- dict new cell-type-enriched genes (Lein et al., 2007)
notes/Q29547320.md:To characterize new astrocyte-specific markers, we examined our gene expression database to identify astrocyte-specific genes with the highest levels of mRNA expression, widest patterns of ISH labeling throughout the brain, and proteins expected to be ex- pressed throughout the whole cell (i.e., not restricted to cellular subcompartments).
notes/Q29547320.md:The list of genes specific to OLs indicates that, in contrast to the list of astrocyte- and neuron-enriched genes, many of the cell- type-specific genes in OLs have been previously characterized. Fifty cell-type-specific genes (⬎20-fold enrichment) were iden- tified. Ofthese genes, 16 are previously well established OL genes such as myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (Mobp), Transferrin (Trf), and Claudin 11 (Cldn11). More than half of these 50 OL-specific genes are associated with the term “membrane” in the DAVID database (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf. gov/), perhaps not surprisingly given the highly specialized func- tion ofOLs in myelin membrane formation.
notes/Q29547320.md:Based on their gene expression profiles, this data suggests that cultured astroglia and in vivo astrocytes are as different from each other as OPCs are from OLs.
notes/Q42585641.md:In most cases, these studies established that any further analyses would be restricted to a well-defined cell population, such as Purkinje cells (Fig- ure 2B), Golgi cells (Figure 2E), or glial cell types, including astrocytes (Aldh1L1), mature oligodendrocytes (Cmtm5), and a mixed oligodendroglial line that included mature oligodendro- cytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors (Olig2).

notes/Q28681367.md:Investigators still primarily seek answers to their questions in an increasingly densely populated collection of articles in the literature, each of which must be digested individually. 
notes/Q28681367.md:If it were easier to search a knowledge base that was structured to answer neuroscience questions, such a system would enable questions to be answered in seconds that would otherwise require hours of literature review.

notes/Q38904507.md:One essential aspect of animal development is cellular differen- tiation. It is known that this process often proceeds in a hierarchi- cal manner, where totipotent cells sequentially commit to fates of more-restricted developmental potential (Graf and Enver, 2009). Thus, the relationship of cell types in ontogeny is expected to form a tree-like structure, although it is also possible that the relationship among cell types can be better represented as net- works of alternative developmental pathways.
notes/Q38904507.md:, we obtained RNA-seq data for six different mesenchymal cell types: chondrocytes (CHONs), myometrial cells (MYOs), myofibroblasts (MFBs), follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), ESFs, and DSCs. Five of them are previously estab- lished cell lines that were isolated and immortalized from normal human tissues.
notes/Q38904507.md:The inferred relationship between ESCs and FDCs imply a his- tory of gene activation and suppression during the evolutionary or ontogenetic differentiation of these cell types. An elementary inference suggests that the genes inferred to have been acquired during the cell differentiation process are likely to be important to the derived function of these cells. We first explored this implica- tion with a gene ontology analysis
notes/Q38904507.md:We interpret the reconstruction of the cell-type tree (Figure 4) as a hypothesis about the evolutionary history of cell-type origi- nation (Arendt 2008). Each branching point on the cell-type tree implies an inferred novelty where a new pair of sister cell types originated from an ancestral cell type.

SCINA assumes that eachmarker follows a bimodal gene expression distribution, whereone peak corresponds to cells from the associated cell type, andthe other peak contains the rest of the cells in the experiment.
notes/Q107158224.md:scmap41is one of the best performing tools for reference-based automatic cell or cluster annotation in terms of bothaccuracy of assigned labels and avoiding incorrect labeling ofnovel cell types33. Other tools for reference-based automaticannotation  include  SingleCellNet42and  SingleR43
notes/Q107158224.md:Sometimes the best reference single-cell map to use for cell annotation is from a different organism. To use such a reference for cell annotation,genes from the query organism must be mapped by orthology to genes from the reference, using databases such as Ensembl118or EggNOG119ortools such as OrthoFind.
notes/Q107158224.md:Ultimately, when annotating cell types, it is prudent to usestandard nomenclature, such as from the Cell Ontology, whichis a hierarchically organized controlled vocabulary of cell typesand subtypes59–61. This enables maps to be more easily inte-grated across studies.
notes/Q107158224.md:Manual annotation should begin by identifying major well-known cell types, indicated by clearly defined, discrete cellclusters, because these are easiest to work with.
notes/Q102054102.md:  We therefore suggest that the ‘tree of cortical cell types’ may look more like a banana tree with a few large leaves, rather than an olive tree with many small ones. In this metaphor, neurons follow a hierarchy consisting of distinct, non-overlapping branches at the level of families (large leaves), but with a spectrum of cells forming continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within each leaf

notes/Q58049549.md: The  term forthe primaryepithelial  cell  of  the  large  intestine  in the TH  is colonocytus (colonocyte).  This  term is  grammaticallyincorrect.  The  termination  oftheGreek  term “colon” is -on,and,thus,the genitive is “coli” (the word root is “col-”). The correct form of  the  term  should  be colocytus (colocyte),  similarto  thewords“coloscopy”(an endoscopic  examination)  and“colostomy” (used  for  the  artificial  opening  of  the  large intestine in the anterior abdominal wall)
notes/Q58049549.md: The   most   striking   discrepancy   is   in   the   usage   of the preposition   pre-(e.g.,preterminalis)  in  Latin  terms.The  last  edition  of the TA  (approved in 1997 andpublished 1998  and  2011)  was  influenced  by  the dominance  of  theEnglish  language,and  that  is  why some Latin terms were simplified(i.e.,orthographic and grammar changes). For example,the diphthong -ae-has been reduced to the sound -e-(presternalis, pretrachealis, prevertebralis). However,  for reasons that are unclear,this conventionwas  not used  in the TH (2008)orTE (2013),but  it  is  again appliedin the Terminologia  Neuroanatomicaand TE2  (2017).

Should we take the Rector normalization approach [5] in building design patterns for the classification of new cell types with granular details of cell attributes such as those exemplified in bipolar neuronal cells (Osumi-Sutherland, this issue)? Or should we extend the ontology by directly asserting the new classes with axiom declarations to supplement the details of the new class attributes when examining cells with detailed surface marker proteins? (Bekken et al., this issue).
notes/Q102232524.md:X  one needs to investigate the thing or things denoted by X ; to discover the nominal definition, one needs to investigate the meaning and use of X.
notes/Q102232524.md:Definitions sought by philosophers are not of the sort found in a dictionary. Frege’s definition of number (1884) and Alfred Tarski’s definition of truth (1983, ch. 8) are not offered as candidates for dictionary entries. The philosophical quest for definition can sometimes fruitfully be characterized as a search for an explanation of meaning
notes/Q102232524.md:First, a stipulative definition should not enable us to establish essentially new claims—call this the Conservativeness criterion.
notes/Q102232524.md:This is perfectly legitimate, according to the traditional account, because a theorem of Peano Arithmetic establishes that the above definition is equivalent to one in normal form.[10] Recursive definitions are circular in their format, and indeed it is this circularity that renders them perspicuous. But the circularity is entirely on the surface, as the existence of normal forms shows.

notes/Q28076577.md:etadata schemata are not enough for comprehensive description of resources, as we also need to know what particular fields mean. For example, different metadata schemata for scientific articles may include a field called ‘subject’, or ‘domain’ but this raises questions: Are ‘subject’ and ‘domain’ intended to codify the same information? Are the values for these fields provided freely by the authors, or do they have to be selected from a controlled vocabulary or an ontology? Such questions are usually addressed when designing application profiles where inter alia vocabularies and/or ontologies associated with particular fields are specified. The resources in Table 3, mainly controlled vocabularies, authority lists and ontologies, are presented because they are used widely and can be useful for improving existing schemata in recording information. 
notes/Q28076577.md:ome words represent structural elements of a document (headers, chapters, sections and paragraphs) or a sentence (subject, predicate and adjective). Others play special roles, such as URL address, name of a person or citation. Finally, some words or their sequences may be names of concepts that are interesting for a particular purpose. We typically refer to the identification of these special roles as annotating and the identified words, with their labels, as annotations. These may be obvious for a human reader, but need to be expressed in a strict machine-readable format to allow automatic text processing.
notes/Q28076577.md:Some of these models were designed by a committee of language annotation professionals, who attempts to cover the widest range of annotation situations in order to build a complete and expressive format. LAF (36), XMI15, and Open Annotation (37) are examples of models designed with this goal in mind.

notes/Q101217428.md:The specific nature of biocuration tasks observed in our survey calls for a shift in the way that we teach biocuration skills. There is a need to develop bioinformatics training that is targeted to biocurators (e.g. pro- gramming skills for biocuration related tasks vs program- ming for research related tasks). Ensuring that all biocurators are up to speed with the latest biocuration and data steward- ship best practices should increase the standard and consistency of biocuration while providing transferable skills that improve career mobility.

notes/Q35906597.md:Evolution and cell differentiation share a number of attributes. First, as mentioned before, we know that cell differentiation transforms less specialized cell types into more specialized ones. Since this transformation is unidi- rectional, the paths of differentiation can be represented as atreestructure,muchasisdonewiththe phyloge- netic trees used to represent evolutionary histories [7].

We use only one replicate per cell type for this work.
notes/Q35906597.md:The lifting approach is important since in cell differentiation, ancestral cell types can coexist with derived cell types in adult organisms. Our approach is easy to use and is probably the only current approach to build cell-type trees with ancestral inference. Hence we feel that our approach will be an effective way to help biologists and bioinformaticians to study the cell differentiation pro- cess.

notes/Q36997786.md:, it is best tocapture that data with the specific terms rather thanannotating to a higher-level term. For example, theSaccharomyces cerevisiaegeneHSP12is annotated tospecific terms ‘cellular response to heat’ [GO:0034605],‘cellular response to osmotic stress’ [GO:0071470] and‘cellular response to oxidative stress’ [GO:0034599] (22)rather than the high level ‘cellular response to stress’[GO:0033554]. Grouping terms such as ‘cellular responseto stress’ are discouraged from use in direct annotationsbecause an experiment would typically not describe theresponse to a global stress, but would rather test theresponse to a specific type of stress.
notes/Q36997786.md:In addition to the evidence code that reflects the type ofexperiment leading to an annotation, the GOC providestwo ways to capture additional evidence information foran annotation: the qualifier and theWITH/FROMcolumn.A qualifier can be used to augment the interpretation ofthe GO term.

notes/Q36539395.md:We present cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT), a computational approach that accurately resolves relative fractions of diverse cell subsets in GEPs from complex tissues (http://cibersort.stanford.edu/).
notes/Q36539395.md:We next investigated CIBERSORT’s discriminatory ability on cell types with correlated GEPs, which can be difficult to resolve in mixtures owing to multicollinearity15. Previous approaches avoid this issue by using cell type–specific marker genes7,8,13 or highly distinct GEPs4,5. In contrast, CIBERSORT does not require cell type–specific expression for every gene, suggesting applicability to diverse cell phenotypes.

notes/Q21284308.md:Several approaches exist to evaluate new ontologies. Obrst et al. suggested six different evaluation techniques for the use of ontologies in life sciences [37-39]:
notes/Q21284308.md:To test the application of CELDA on the representation of developmental trees, we chose to represent cell types involved in human kid- ney development in order to reduce the data scope.
notes/Q21284308.md:The label “cell type” probably rests on a confu- sion between the two relations of instantiation and subclasshood (which are not distinguished, e.g., in many thesauri [54]). While subclasses of the class Cell are, of course, types of cells, all instances of Cell are particular cells that exist at a certain time and could, e.g., be viewed under the microscope. A closer inspection of the use of the label “cell type” showed that its instances (or at least instances of subclasses) were, in fact, meant to be particular cells. The general lesson to be learnt is that ontology designers should be very careful with the nam- ing and should also have an eye on problems that could occur when the ontology to be developed is combined with other resources.
notes/Q21284308.md:A difficult issue was brought up by the question of
notes/Q102205732.md:Over the last decade an increasing share of biological experiments involve multiple technologies assaying different biological modalities, such as epigenetics, and RNA and protein expression, and thus the BioStudies database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) was established to deal with such multimodal data. Its central concept is a study, which typically is associated with a publication. BioStudies stores metadata describing the study, provides links to the relevant databases, such as European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), as well as hosts the types of data for which specialized databases do not exist
notes/Q100560052.md:We next asked whether osmotic and hypovolaemic stresses are detected by the same neurons in the CVOs. To test this, we employed an activity-dependent genetic labelling strategy in which FOS-positive neurons can be permanently labelled (TRAP213; Extended Data Fig. 1d)
notes/Q28595082.md:Evidence for cell-type-specific dependence on Reelin signaling for proper positioning was found in the postero- dorsal medial amygdala (MEApd; Fig. 23). Both estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2) and calcitonin receptor (Calcr) are locally restricted to MEApd, with overlapping spatial distributions but nonoverlapping cellular distributions (Fig. 24) in P7 wt mice. Although Esr2-positive cells in reeler mice are maintained in a tight nuclear fashion, Calcr expression shows a much more diffuse pattern spread throughout the MEA extending beyond the poster- odorsal region.
notes/Q106833747.md:To address this issue, considerable effort has been invested in creating sample metadata hubslike Biosamples (Courtot et al. 2019) where human curators use semi-automated workflows(“ZOOMA” n.d.) to manually annotate samples by assigning them with terms in controlledvocabularies or ontologies (Jupp et al. 2015) such as the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon)(Mungall et al. 2012). Others have developed similar web platforms for manual sampleannotation (Quiñones et al. 2020) and explored crowdsourcing to curate sample annotations(Wang et al. 2016; Hadley et al. 2017). The latter efforts are usually case studies and rely on aninterested and available population of individuals to spread out the burden of manual curation.While they often provide high-quality annotations, automated high-throughput methods areneeded to keep up with the scale of available samples, which already totals to more than amillion and continues to grow exponentially

The mature state in which expression of Olfr genes is restricted to one per neuron emerges over a developmental progression that appears independent of neuronal activity requiring sensory transduction molecules.

notes/Q106315467.md:We compared the inflammatory and cyto-kine scores among all of the cell subtypes captured in BALF.No enrichment of cytokine genes was observed in epithelialcells, while subtypes of macrophages and monocytes had thehighest cytokine and inflammatory scores in the progression (se-vere) samples (Figure 7A)
notes/Q106234628.md:The strongest evidence for a specific macrophage subtype in the erythroblastic island comes from the mouse, where F4/80 antigen and Forssman glycosphingolipid expression, but not Mac1 expression, are enriched in these cells
notes/Q106234628.md:. Of relevance to human biology (May and Forrester, 2020), although the positive effects of EKLF expression on island macrophage function have been previously noted (Lopez-Yrigoyen et al., 2019), it is also relevant that a recent single-cell analysis of human FL hematopoiesis shows that EKLF and many of its target genes identified in the present study are also expressed in the ‘Vcam1+ erythroblastic island macrophage’ cluster (Popescu et al., 2019).

notes/Q89748559.md:There were marked differences in the activation and memory status of T and B cells between the colon and lymph nodes, suggesting  that  these  cell  types  are  molded  by  their  environment  (Fig. 2c,d).

notes/Q89748559.md:As observed previously in the mouse22, subclustering of Treg cells from the MLNs revealed major populations of central Treg cells and effector Treg cells (Fig. 4a). Central Treg cells were defined by the high-est expression of SELL, while effector Treg cells were characterized by genes  associated  with  the  TNFRSF-NFκB  pathway  (TNFRSF9  and  TNF; Supplementary Fig. 4a)
notes/Q54963746.md:While authors are in the best position to curate their own data, they face a steep learning curve to ensure that appropriate referential tags, metadata, and ontologies are applied correctly to their observations, a task sometimes considered beyond the scope of their research and other numerous responsibilities.
notes/Q54963746.md:The micropublication has been more loosely defined, to contain the same semantic component with assertion as nanopublications (3), but with some leeway to contain more explanatory free text.

notes/Q94938805.md:), the specific cell subsets within each tissue that express ACE2 remain unknown. Identifying the cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2+) and those at greatest risk of direct infection (ACE2+TMPRSS2+) is critical for understanding and modulating host defense mechanisms and viral pathogenesis.
notes/Q94938805.md:To investigate which cells within human and NHP tissues represent likely SARS-CoV-2 targets, we analyzed new and existing scRNA-seq datasets to assess which cell types express ACE2, alone or with TMPRSS2.

notes/Q104043701.md:The number of known species of eukaryotic organisms is currently estimated to be about 1.4 million. It seems reasonable to suppose that most of Earth’s species have been described. But this is far from true.
notes/Q104043701.md:I began this book at the request of some ecologist colleagues who were finding undescribed species in the course of their research and wanted to know what steps they should take to get those species named.
notes/Q104043701.md:I anticipate grumbling from a few ofm y colleagues who seem to feel that systematics should remain an esoteric pursuit. They are convinced that if “amateurs” acquire the information they need to publish taxonomic papers, the result will be a horrendous proliferation of poorly delimited species and a great increase in confusion in the literature. However, although following established taxonomic procedure may be time-consuming and occasionally tedious, it is not especially difficult.
notes/Q104043701.md:Far from being written in stone, the present rules are the result of many hard-fought scientific battles over the last 200 years. They represent the best compromise taxonomists have come up with to deal with two diametrically opposing needs: the need to name, to provide each organism with a unique and stable name; and the need to classify, to provide a system of classification that is explanatory and predictive.

notes/Q104043701.md:Even if your description is the best that it was possible to write at the time it is published, it still might not be sufficient to distinguish your species from a new relative discovered at some future time, without restudy of your type specimen.
notes/Q104043701.md:Whereas the number of taxonomic characters that could be mentioned in a description may indeed be limited “only by the patience of the investigator” (Mayr et al. 1953:106), a diagnosis includes just the characters that distinguish that species from others.
notes/Q104043701.md:"The other people who are likely to deal with subspecific variation are graduate students and professionals in genetics and conservation biology, who often end up studying variation within a species. They are almost the only biologists now doing “gamma” taxonomy, once considered to be the highest form of systematics."
notes/Q104043701.md:"A revision involves restudy ofa group to correct or improve its diagnosis, description, or phylogeny. As Mayr (1969) pointed out, this is one of the most important types of scientific publication for groups in which many new species are still being described."

notes/Q38798014.md:Defines many interesting concepts:
notes/Q38798014.md:Cell type homology: Cell types that trace back to the same cell type in a common ancestor.
notes/Q38798014.md:Sister cell types: Cell types arising by the splitting of an ancestral cell type into two descendant cells via the process of individuation.
notes/Q38798014.md:Assumes directly, from scratch, that cell types are restricted to single species.
notes/Q98633613.md:The fact that multiple cell-types exist within unicellular and aggregative organisms suggests that the origin of cellular differentiation is largely independent of the route to multicellularity [14,15]. Thus, the task at hand becomes finding an explanation for cell differentiation in any given multicellular context, being clonal or aggregative, without conflating explanations for multicellular evolution itself.
notes/Q98633613.md:What Counts as a Cell Type? A meaningful explanation of the evolution of cell types requires de minimus a clear and canonical definition of what counts as a ‘cell-type’.At first glance, it would appear that cell types differ in terms of either their morphology or function, or both. Surprisingly, however, there is no general agree- ment on the extent to which morphological or functional divergence is required to identify a particular type of cell as different from other types, and the answers largely depend on the particular organism of interest, or a given method of classification.
notes/Q98633613.md:For example, is each data cluster a true ‘cell–type', or could they be snapshots of the dynamics of a single type? The opposite question also emerges: could different cell types be misassigned to the same cluster simply because they happen to have partially overlapping dynamics?
notes/Q98633613.md:BNs are abstract constructs used to model cell differentiation without referring to a particular biological system [41]. One advantage of this discrete approach is that it allows one to ask con- crete theoretical questions without focusing on the diverse details of a real biological system, which is required in most continuous models (e.g., with the use of differential equations), where empirically verified rate constants are usually necessary. Instead of considering the details of a system, BNs focus on the logic of the interactions between the components of the systems. Although they might appear abstract at first glance, BN models have been used to accurately model cellular differentiation in numerous systems, including plants, flies, yeast, humans, andmany other kinds of organism (e.g., [42–47]). Thus, the Boolean framework allows one to pose specific questions and to test specific hypotheses in an intuitive way without losing power or generality (e.g., [48,49]). So far, no other model of cellular differentiation has the same advantages.
notes/Q98633613.md:Therefore, it is crucial that future research develops a dynamic reciprocity between theorists and empiricists, because only then will we be able to break current constraints on our ability to reveal deep insights into the fundamental question of how cells differentiate.

notes/Q105037759.md:interest requires the knowledge of various technologies
notes/Q105037759.md:and procedures to extract the information of interest.
notes/Q52560248.md:We focused on thewestern claw-toed frog,Xenopus tropicalis,which serves as one of the best-studied mod-el systems of early vertebrate development.We profiled these embryos from just beforethe onset of zygotic transcription up to a pointat which dozens of distinct cell types haveformed encompassing progenitors of most major organs.
notes/Q52560248.md:To establish aspects of devel-opment general to vertebrates, we addition-ally incorporated data from the copublishedpaper by Wagneret al. on zebrafish embryos,which separated from frogs about 400 mil-lion years ago.
notes/Q52560248.md:Given the close association and conservation oftranscription factors with differentiation, andhence cell type, we asked two questions: (i) Howare transcription factors deployed across celltypes and across time during development? (ii) How, at the level of genes, do new cell iden-tities emerge at branch points in development?These questions can be examined here in dozensof cell states and in the unperturbed setting ofthe embryo, rather than in cell culture.
notes/Q52560248.md:Our single-cell data offers an opportunity toreexamine these alternative hypotheses with ahigh-resolution view of the intermediate statesbetween blastula and neurula stages in neuralcrest development. To support the“retentionmodel,”we specifically searched for a subsetof cells that maintain a blastula gene expressionprogram, distinct from the remaining early ec-toderm. To further increase the likelihood offinding such cells, we supplemented our wholeembryo time series with additional scRNA-seqdata (9308 cells) collected from tissue that wedissected from the neural plate border region,which is fated to become neural crest, of stage11 embryos, immediately before the expressionof neural crest genes (total of 15,426 stage 11cells).
notes/Q92354852.md:n this study, we aimed to identify a method of tissuepreservation that would stabilize intact human tissuesamples for scRNA-seq but that requires minimal pro-cessing at the clinic and allows sample transportationtime. In order to contribute to the Human Cell Atlas, wetested the method on three human primary tissues ex-pected to have different sensitivities to ischemia [22]:spleen (most stable), esophagus mucosa, and lung (leaststable) [22]. These tissues contain cell types rangingfrom immune cells to keratinocytes.
notes/Q92354852.md:Having generated datasets for the esophagus, lung, andspleen, we examined if cell types that can be found in allthree organs, such as immune cells, would cluster byorgan or by cell type. Figure5c shows the result of hier-archical clustering using the 1000 most highly variablegenes in up to 10 cells per cell type, tissue, time, anddonor. In this analysis of approximately 7500 cells, wesee clear subclusters of mast cells, macrophages, andplasma cells with some substructure depending on thedonor and the tissue of origin, suggesting that more ex-tensive analysis will allow us to study tissue adaptationof different immune cell populations.
notes/Q92354852.md:Relatively high variabilityin the proportions of cell types was seen between sam-ples. This was likely to be due to technical variation aswell as underlying biological variation as indicated bythe capture of rare structures such as glandular cells inonly some esophagus samples, namely from donor 325Cand 356C. Interestingly, histology on sections fromdonor 325C (12 h) confirmed the presence of glands(mucous secreting cells; Additional file1: Figure S2) thatwere not present in the other esophagus samples sec-tioned.

notes/Q57402167.md:- To provide a starting point for researchers interested in CNL 
notes/Q57402167.md:A controlled language (CL) is a restricted version of a natural language which has been engineered to meet a special purpose, most often that of writing technical documentation for non-native speakers of the document language. A typical CL uses a well-defined subset of a language’s grammar and lexicon, but adds the terminology needed in a technical domain. (Kittredge 2003, page 441)
notes/Q57402167.md:They agree, however, on the fact that a CNL is based on a certain natural language but is more restrictive. It is also generally agreed that CNLs are constructed languages, which means languages that did not emerge naturally but have been engineered.
notes/Q57402167.md:Definition 2 (short): A controlled natural language is a constructed language that is based on a certain natural language, being more restrictive concerning lexicon, syntax, and/or semantics, while preserving most of its natural properties.
notes/Q57402167.md:Many variations exist that use larger word sets. The Simple English version of Wikipedia,3 for example, claims to use Basic English, but in fact uses a much less restricted language
notes/Q57402167.md:Caterpillar Fundamental English (CFE) (Verbeke 1973) was an influential controlled language developed at Caterpillar. It was officially introduced in 1971, was based on Basic English (Smart 2003), and has been reported to be the earliest industry-based CNL (Wojcik and Hoard 1997). The need for a controlled language emerged because of the increasing sophistication of Caterpillar’s products and the need to communicate with non-English speaking service personnel in different countries
notes/Q57402167.md:Less imprecise languages (P2). For these languages, the degree of ambiguity and vague- ness is considerably lower than in natural languages, and their interpretation depends much less on context. They restrict the use and/or the meaning of a wide range of the respective ambiguous, vague, or context-dependent constructs. However, these con- structs are still too dominant to make automatic interpretation reliable. Such languages are typically not related to a formal (i.e., mathematically precise) underpinning

notes/Q59753943.md:To test whether STARmap could deliver on the initial goal of high-content 3D intact-tissue sequencing of single-cell transcriptional states with the necessary sensitivity and accuracy, we applied STARmap to a pressing challenge in neuroscience: detecting and classifying cell types and corresponding tissue-organization principles in the neocortex of the adult mouse brain..
notes/Q59753943.md:In general, it may not be possible to fully define brain cell typology independent of such 3D anatomy as well as activity patterns exhibited and experienced by cells during behavior; the nature of input and output communication pathways for the cells in question in fact can form the foundation for defining cell types (35, 36). Toward this end, in situ transcriptomics exemplified by STARmap can effectively link this imaging-based molecular information with complementary cellular-resolution datastreams describing anatomy, natural activity, and causal importance, thus promising to fundamentally deepen our understanding of brain function and dysfunction (2).
notes/Q26782737.md:In 1957, C.H. Waddington proposed a powerful metaphor for how differentiated cell types emerge from a single, totipotent cell. A dynamical systems view of the cell. A cell’s state at a given time as a point in “gene regulation space.” As the cell regulates gene expression during development, it moves through the space along a trajectory. The central question posed by Waddington is: Where will the cell end up?

notes/Q98568691.md:We find that lineage divergence in the opos- sum initiates late in development. It has previously been suggested52 that, in eutherians, lineage divergence to generate the TE and pluri- blast (the progenitor of the EPI and PrE) occurs precociously because implantation in these mammals occurs early. Our findings support this view. Whether a pluriblast exists in the opossum remains an open question, which we discuss further in Supplementary Information 9.
notes/Q26253817.md:As a first step in the knowledge-base design, we sought the optimal level of description to capture the largest possible extent of available information.

Interestingly, only one such case is known: in CA1, Cajal–Retzius cells, which were recently characterized as glutamatergic and more abundant than previously assumed in adult rats (Quattrocolo and Maccaferri, 2014), and (GABAergic) Neurogliaform cells (Price et al., 2005) have both axons and dendrites confined to SLM, though with extremely different arbor densities and shapes. Thus, putatively excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus tend to have completely distinct morphologies. Although

Unlike XML, which has an inher-ently hierarchical structure, in RDF ‘everything is a resourcethat  connects  with  other  resources  via  properties.
notes/Q95815991.md:Is this the solution we are all waiting for? Well, not really.

Only a modest fraction of the genes identified as ‘markers’ of specific interneuron subtypes in any one species had this property in another species.
notes/Q100395427.md:Such expression variation across species creates challenges in choosing selective markers to characterize conserved cell types: only a modest subset of the genes selected for cell-type-specific expression within one species may have this property in another species (Extended Data Fig. 3a), particularly across the evolutionary distances that separate mice (or ferrets) from primate\

Taken together, the collec- tion of properties, which defines a neuron type, also constitutes a set of sufficient conditions for a neuron to be of that type. This means that if a neuron has all of those properties, then it must be of that type. The adoption of “necessary and sufficient” properties is opposed to a “comprehensive description” of neu- ron types. The Neuron Registry aims at a minimal description of neuron types, in the sense ofonly including definitional informa- tion, rather than being generically descriptive. As such, there is no restriction on the range of neural property descriptors as long as the “necessary and sufficient” criterion is met.
notes/Q28730328.md:we have ini- tiated an Adopt-a-Neuron Campaign (adopt.a.neuron@incf.org) encouraging (self-)nomination of neuroscience experts to curate the properties of their specific neuron(s) of interest. A paral- lel Representation and Deployment Task Force (RDTF) is envi- sioned to support the activity of the Neuron Registry by ensuring that the relations linking the ontological classes and the values of instances are compliant with rigorous ontological principles (http://obofoundry.org). This separate curation step removes the necessity for the neuroscience experts to also possess and respect formal ontology expertise while trying to resolve open questions and/or integrate existing knowledge about neuron types. The end result will also be ready for incorporation into broader cell ontology efforts (http://cellontology.org).

notes/Q58587002.md:Since evidence comes in many flavors and its consistent storage is of such importance to effective annotation, a systematic way to organize types of evidence and apply them in annotations is essential. An ontology is the best solution to this challenge. An ontology is a controlled vocabulary of terms (or classes) related to each other in defined ways.
notes/Q58587002.md:To accomplish this, ECO has been harmonizing with OBI, an orthogonal ontology in the biomedical domain (11). Whereas ECO covers evidence and assertion methods, OBI provides a mechanism to clearly capture information about scientific investigations through more than 2500 terms describing objectives, assays and devices.

notes/Q21093639.md:tension between modelling best practice and modelling skills [11] is a fundamental barrier for progress in bio-ontologies, as the bio-ontologists only rarely use the whole power of KR languages.
notes/Q21093639.md:Some attempts have been made to provide best practice guidelines in ontology engineering and KR, which in some cases are semantically equivalent to ODPs. Some of those efforts have been collected (albeit not as a systema- tized collection) in the W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group web [67]
notes/Q21093639.md:The use of ODPs will most likely give several advantages to bio-ontologists when creating and maintaining bio- ontologies.

This enables neuronal activity to be precisely controlled using light (a method known as optogenetics), and so allowed the authors to dissect the roles of the upper and the lower layer-5 neurons in different types of motor function. These markers could be used to design more optogenetic experiments that target specific neuronal populations; to investigate whether ‘area-specific’ cell types can be found in other cortical regions;

This challenge was also addressed at A Cell Type Ontology Workshop (Seattle, June 17-18, 2019; hosted by the Allen Institute, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)), where input from representatives from the fields of ontology, taxonomy, and neuroscience made recommendations, highlighted best practices and proposed conventions for naming cell type
notes/Q104247451.md:Such databases can be implemented using knowledge graph based environments (Alshahrani et al., 2017; Waagmeester et al., 2020), which allow traversal up the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy (Rowley, 2007). A potential output of these efforts is the “Cell Type Card”, which is a website that would compile myriad information about a specific cell set as a centralized resource. This idea has been successfully implemented for individual genes (www.genecards.org), and a prototype based on transcriptomic content was recently released as part of a study of mouse hippocampus and cortex (Yao et al., 2020b) (https://taxonomy.shinyapps.io/ctx_hip_browser/) .

notes/Q103045800.md:FR-Match: robust matching of cell type clusters from single cell RNA sequencing data using the Friedman-Rafsky non-parametric test
notes/Q103045800.md:We adopted the NS-Forest algorithm [14]v2.0(https://github. com/JCVenterInstitute/NSForest) to select informative marker genes for a given cell type cluster. Applying NS-Forest feature selection to the cortical Layer 1 and full thickness MTG datasets produced a collection of 34 and 157 marker genes that, in combination, can distinguish the 16 cortical Layer 1 [28]and 75 full MTG [29] cell type clusters, respectively.
notes/Q103045800.md:Although NS-Forest was used for marker gene selection here, FR-Match is compatible with any feature selec- tion/dimensionality reduction approach that selects informative cluster classification features.
notes/Q103045800.md:For example, the ‘Inh_L1_2_PAX6_CDH12’ from the MTG dataset means the inhibitory neurons located in layer 1–2 within the PAX6- subclass/subbranch expressing CDH12. The leaf node marker genes are preferentially selected by a binary scoring scheme [29] different from the one used by NS-Forest. Thus, the ‘cell type naming genes’ provide an alternative informative marker gene set
notes/Q103045800.md:The negative effect of under-partitioned clusters also applies to the nested classes of heterogeneous cell types
notes/Q103045800.md:Automated cell type integration of independent scRNAseq datasets remains challenging. Creating an unbiased, high-resolution and comprehensive cell type reference would be a critical task for the whole single cell research community. Consensus mapping schemes that survey both cell-level and cluster-level matchings will be useful for establishing such a reference data atlas. We believe that final mapping of the brain cell types agreed upon by the type of bi-directionally and multi- level matchings reported here represents the best-practice for computational cell type mapping, requiring minimal expert intervention.

notes/Q94558276.md:s. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) gene curation framework was used to assess genetic and experimental evidence of associations between 208 genes and conditions screened on two commercial ECS panels. Twenty-one conditions were previously classified by ClinGen, and the remaining 187 were evaluated by curation teams at two laboratories. To ensure consistent application of the framework across the laboratories, concordance was evaluated on a subset of conditions. All 208 evaluated conditions met the evidence threshold for supporting a gene-disease association. Furthermore, 203 of 208 (98%) achieved the strongest (“Definitive”) level of gene-disease association.
notes/Q94558276.md: For example, of 21 genes included on panels assessing single-gene causes of Brugada syndrome, an arrhythmia condition that increases risk for sudden cardiac death, only one gene (SCN5A) was classified as having Definitive evidence of clinical validity, while the remaining 20 were classified as Disputed (Hosseini et al., 2018). The study concluded that more evidence was needed before genes other than SCN5A are tested as the cause of Brugada syndrome (Hosseini et al., 2018).
notes/Q94558276.md:In this study, one gene, HYLS1, was classified as having Limited evidence, the lowest of the supportive categories. In several studies applying the ClinGen framework, discussion of genes classified as Limited has noted the need to regularly revisit curations so that new evidence can be assessed (Grant et al., 2018; McGlaughon et al., 2019; Renard et al., 2018). McGlaughon,Goldstein, Thaxton, Hemphill, and Berg (2018) retrospectively analyzed classifications of 22 gene-disease pairs curated yearly, and found that gene-disease associations at the low end of the Limited point range (<2 points) are more likely to remain Limited or become Disputed/Refuted than those initially scored in mid to upper Limited point range (2–6 points) (McGlaughon et al., 2018)
notes/Q57462271.md:It has been established, for example, that each anatomically distinct, classically defined cell type expresses a set of genes that is characteristic (Dougherty et al., 2010; Doyle et al., 2008), that these genes confer properties that are essential for specialized cellular functions (Kim et al., 2008; Nakajima et al., 2014), and that the expression of these genes is highly correlated with cell specific epigenetic states that organize nuclear function (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009; Melle´n et al., 2012)

notes/Q104092178.md:multiple ways of saying the same thing. We plan to test how well we are doing by building AMRs on top of large, manually-constructed paraphrase networks from the HyTER project
notes/Q87818346.md: To achieve this, we establish a mapping system consisting of a Wikipedia-based scoring algorithm and a named entity normalization method (NEN). The mapping system makes full use of information available on Wikipedia, which is a comprehensive Internet medical knowledge base. We also built a new ontology, Tree of Human Body Parts (THBP), from core anatomical parts by referring to anatomical experts and Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) to make the mapping system efficacious for clinical treatments.
notes/Q87818346.md:For explicit anatomical related entities, there are dictionary-based methods (e.g., string-matching) that can conduct mapping. However, quite a few implicit anatomical related entities cannot be mapped to certain body parts by string-matching methods. The reason is that there is no common substring between the entities and the body parts. For example, the following two sentences come from a discharge summary:“Given this, it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding”.“The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday, 11-02”.If we use string-matching, colonoscopy which is a medical test can be mapped to colon because of the common string “colon”. However, “sigmoidoscopy”, which is also a medical test related to colon, cannot be mapped to “colon” since the string “sigmoidoscopy” does not contain the substring “colon”. In Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Term (SNOMED-CT) [6], several entities are mapped to more than one terms. Therefore, although there exists some implicit relationships in SNOMED-CT, it is difficult to distinguish the exact concept for one entity in one certain context from more than one matched terms.

notes/Q105870680.md:Even terms for important high-level concepts and relations that are fundamental to life sciences are often used inconflicting or ambiguous ways (Smith and Rosse, 2004).One prominent example is the conceptgene. For GDB (Fasmanet al., 1996),a gene is a “DNA fragment that can be transcribed and translated into a protein”.For GenBank (Bensonet al., 1997) and GSDB (Keenet al., 1996), a gene is a“DNA region of biological interest with a name and that carries a genetic traitor phenotype”. The latter definition is problematic, not only because it makes theanswer to the question of which genes exist depend on the vagaries of humannaming acts but also because it comprehends nonstructural coding DNA regionssuch as intron, promoter, and enhancer.
notes/Q105870680.md:2.1.    Upper-level ontologiesThe first important ontologist was Aristotle (384–322 BC) who, among many otherthings, pursued the question of how reality is organized into classes or universals.His solution is presented in hisCategories, which can be seen as the first upper-level ontology (Barnes, 1984). From Aristotle’s point of view, 10 categories sufficeto express anything that can be known about something:•Substance•Quantity•Quality•Relation•Place•Time•Situation•Condition•Action•Affection.

notes/Q103800764.md:We confirm the presence of distinct brown adipocyte populations in vivo using the markers EIF5, TCF25, and BIN1. We also demonstrate that loss of Bin1 enhances UCP1 expression and mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that BIN1 marks dormant brown adipocytes.
notes/Q103800764.md:Sebo and colleagues, reported that in addition to Pax3+/Myf5+ cells, a minor fraction of interscapular brown adipocytes derive from the central dermomyotome expressing Pax7 and Myf5 (13). Thus, these data suggest that more than one brown adipocyte precursor cell population might exist, albeit the current dogma suggests a single precursor population (12).
notes/Q103800764.md:These findings also raise the question if murine BAT is, as commonly believed, composed of one brown adipocyte lineage, or a mixture of brown adipocytes derived from multiple lineages.
notes/Q103800764.md:To overcome the limitations of a static experimental setup such as scRNAseq, we established 67 clonal cell lines, derived from the SV40 large-T immortalized SVF of three 8-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice. Most cell lines, when differentiated for 8 d, accumulated lipids,
notes/Q103800764.md:several clones (1B1, 1B3 and 1B6, 2C12, 3C7 and 3D6) that diverged and showed higher Pparg expression than anticipated from the lipid content.

notes/Q103800764.md:To investigate the distribution of the selected marker genes in relation to UCP1 in mature adipocytes in vivo, we performed co-immunostainings for EIF5, TCF25, and BIN1 with UCP1 on murine BAT sections. EIF5 expression correlated with UCP1 staining intensity (Fig 6F). Following our quantification strategy applied for UCP1 (Fig 1A), we quantified EIF5 expression in individual brown adipocytes and grouped the cells according to high, medium, low, and very low expression, with around 1/4 of the brown adipocytes showing high or very high expression (Figs 6G
notes/Q103800764.md:In the current study, we aimed to clarify the presence of distinct brown adipocyte lineages in mice. We find that even at room temperature, where murine BAT appears morphologically uniform, UCP1 expression within individual brown adipocytes differs greatly throughout the tissue. To this end, we tested if differences in UCP1 content are the result of developmental heterogeneity among murine brown adipocytes and not due to anatomical or environ- mental differences.
notes/Q103800764.md:Schematic illustration of brown adipose tissue heterogeneity: Murine brown adipose tissue is composed of functionally distinct brown adipocytes. We identify EIF5 expressing brown adipocytes as “classical” brown adipocytes, with high UCP1 content and mitochondrial uncoupling. TCF25 expressing brown adipocytes are similar, albeit with lower UCP1 expression. In contrast, BIN1-expressing brown adipocytes appear in a dormant state, expressing low UCP1 levels with little response to beta adrenergic stimulation. However, loss of BIN1 or chemical mitochondrial uncoupling reveals high thermogenic capacity of these cells. Subpopulations of brown adipocytes are color coded regarding to their thermogenic capacity, with the highest shown in dark brown (Eif5high), followed by brown (Tcf25high) and light brown (Bin1high) (=indicates unchanged expression).
notes/Q83226392.md:It is well established that certain neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P, and cholecystokinin (CCK), are detectible at high levels in particular subsets of GABAergic cortical neurons (Tremblay et al., 2016). These neuropeptides have come into broad use as markers for particular GABAergic interneuron classes, while the corresponding NPP and NP-GPCR genetics have provided molecular access to these and other broad neuron type classes (Daigle et al., 2018; Maximiliano José et al., 2018)

notes/Q27887654.md:Box 1 |Types of crowdsourcingGenerally speaking, crowdsourcing can refer to efforts in which the crowd provides data (for example, patients provide their medical information) to be mined by others or, alternatively, to initiatives in which the crowd actively works on solving a problem66. One type of active crowdsourcing is labour-focused crowdsourcing, in which work that needs to be done is proposed to a community willing to take up such a job13. A well-known example of labour-focused crowdsourcing is the ‘Mechanical Turk’ run by Amazon. The Mechanical Turk approach provides an online workforce that allows people to complete work, or ‘human intelligence tasks’, in exchange for a small amount of money67.A complex problem can be divided into a set of smaller, independent tasks to benefit from crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing data annotation and curation in bioinformatics can be handled well with this approach. This scheme has also been applied to provide pathway resources68,69, reconstruct the human metabolic network70, annotate molecular interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis71 and identify crucial errors in ontologies72.In contrast to labour-focused forms of crowdsourcing, there are forms of crowdsourcing in which individuals participate because of their interest in the project or cause13. An example of this is the crowdsourced approach taken to develop the popular community encyclopedia Wikipedia. In some instances (such as Wikipedia and the protein structure game Foldit73), participants contribute their time and intellectual capacity, whereas in other examples (such as the Folding@home74 and Rosetta@home75 protein folding projects), participants provide computational power from their personal equipment to help solve the problem.In some instances, crowdsourcing can be implemented in the form of a game76 to maximize the number of solvers who work on the problem and to increase the likelihood that they will stay engaged. For example, in the Foldit project, the problem of determining protein structure is transformed into an entertaining game. Such ‘gamification’, in which game-design elements are used to allow an enjoyable experience, has proved a spectacular approach to raise participant numbers and interest. It also leads to results: Foldit’s 57,000 players provided useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions73. Foldit was followed by a similarly popular project, EteRNA77, in which more than 26,000 participants provided an RNA sequence that fits a given shape. The best designs, as chosen by the community, were then tested experimentally73,78. Hence, gamification is a powerful tool to engage massive numbers of volunteer citizen scientists to solve complex problems in which human intuition can outperform computer algorithms, even for abstract problems such as quantum computing79
notes/Q27887654.md:A major consideration in using the Challenge framework is the question of how best to incentivize participation. The most typical incentives are monetary awards, the possibility to co-author a high-profile paper reporting on a Challenge, an invitation to present the best-performing method at a conference or the desire to access and analyse the data sets provided in the Challenge.• Given that meaningful participation requires a substantial time investment from each team, a ‘winner-takes-all’ approach for selecting top performers can limit the diversity and depth of involvement, whereas intermediate awards can directly motivate participants to exert costly effort.• Unsportsmanlike behaviour — in which participants register under different identities in order to send more predictions to the leaderboard than allowed — has been observed, but fortunately this is rare and not difficult to detect

notes/Q41052480.md:Many schemes of ganglion cell classification seek to classify the cells by some particular characteristic, such as the time course of the cells’ physiological responses or their dendritic morphology. It is here argued that such schemes are based on the Aristotelian concept of ‘essences’ and raise the same difficulties as have arisen with the essentialist approach to animal taxonomy. A better approach to the classification of neurones, it is proposed, is to base the classification on as many features of the cells as possible, and to regard the classification as an hypothesis, sub? ject to testing and modification by experience, about the ‘functional niches’ occupied by the cell types distinguished.
notes/Q41052480.md:The categorising of properties as ‘accidental’ has often downgraded interest in them, resulting, as Tyner [1975] expresses it, ‘in much data being effectively discarded by either labelling atypical individuals “unnatural” or by creating for them new groups containing extremely small fractions of the total sample.’
notes/Q41052480.md:The first problem is the tend? ency of the essentialist approach to make no distinction between descrip? tion and definition. In animal taxonomy, this distinction is embodied in the distinction between taxa and categories [Bock, 1973; see below]. Ca? tegories, such as family or species, can be defined, but taxa, such as Felidae or Felis domesticus, may only be described.
notes/Q41052480.md:These clusterings of properties may indicate some functional distinction between the two groups, and seem sufficient to justify a division of W cells into two subgroups. We suggest that these subgroups be given the non-descriptive names Wt and W2.
notes/Q41052480.md:To summarise the critique of ganglion cell classifications presented above, it is not meant to suggest that any particular scheme of classifying ganglion cells, whether by morphology or physiology, is the correct one. We do mean to suggest that certain schemes are simpler, more adaptable to new findings and less likely to be a source of confusion than others. In the following, more theoretical section, an attempt is made to set out principles by which such schemes of classification might be devised for neuronal populations.
notes/Q41052480.md:Darwin [1872, p. 576] suggested ‘... that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been seeking, and not ... the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.’ Thus, the theory of evolution made it possible for classifications of animals to be regarded as hypotheses about phylogenetic or cladistic relationships between them, and the aim of taxonomy became, in the words of J. S. Huxley [1940, p. 2], ‘the discovery of evolution at work’
notes/Q41052480.md:- As an hypothesis, a scheme of classification is a testable proposition, intended to be modified or even discarded if necessary, and therefore inherently adaptable to new accumulations of data. 
notes/Q41052480.md:- Because observa? tions used to generate hypotheses cannot validly be used to test them, the testing process itself results in the collection of new data. The classification thus has the effect of generating new observations, rather than of formalising old ones.
notes/Q41052480.md:We would suggest that the functional roles played by various neurones do provide a basis for their classification into groups; and that the classification should be regarded as an hypothesis that particular groups of neurones fill particular functional niches.
notes/Q41052480.md:One word of caution should be added here. The hypothesis that groups of cells in different species occupy the same functional niche is not to be equated with the suggestion that these groups are homologous. The criteria for the establishment of homology are independent of (although they overlap with) the considerations involved in defining a functional niche. Groups of cells in different species could occupy the same functional niche as a result of either homology or homoplasy.
notes/Q34846475.md:Cell: Cellular data is collected at specific developmental time points or embryonic stages (e.g. Theiler stage for mouse or Carnegie stages for human). Detailed developmental paths taken by cells directed toward specific fates, such as blood, endothelium, skeletal muscles, bone, cartilage etc. Somatic cells transverse a developmental path, which defines their cellular ontology from their first ancestor or ancestors (termed ‘‘primary progenitor’’) to the fully differentiated cell type.

Following that reasoning, knowledge of the exact or even approximate in vivo identity of a cell, i.e. it’s correlation to the developmental ancestry tree and its anatomical location or tissue type classification can extremely useful. This type of information has been previously scattered in papers and specific databases, and difficult or impossible to associate or assemble with the developmental context.

This sharedattitude confers on the volume the interesting aspect of map of the relevant questions andanswers within the present state of knowledge
notes/Q47407732.md:Christophe Malaterre (this volume) offers an interesting reflection on the general questionof the methods commonly used for reaching the definition of any term. This subject hasbeen extensively treated by logicians and linguists (e.g. Clark and Welsh1962; Robinson1950). First, one should distinguish between lexical definitions and stipulative definitions.
notes/Q47407732.md: In his reflection on essentialism, the philosopher KarlPopper has provided a powerful critical tool (Popper1945). For Popper, essentialism (aword coined by himself) is a conception of scientific knowledge that privileges questions ofthe sort“What is a certain sort of thing?”,or“What is its true nature?”. Privileging suchquestions leads to a practice based upon the idea that the essential task of science is todefine, in the sense of expressing the essence of something. Popper considers that thisattitude has been the major source of sterility in the history of science as well as inphilosophy since Antiquity
notes/Q47407732.md:But, if we want to go further and provide a general definition of life, wemust be aware that it cannot be more than a stipulative definition, in relation with particularscientific theories. Such a definition will always be conventional, and for this reason, thewisest attitude that we may have is to accept that it is open to change, in response to newknowledge. If we do not accept this, Popper would probably go on, we must be aware thatwe enter into the realm of metaphysics.
notes/Q47407732.md:Bruylants/Bartik/Reisse go in thesame direction. They propose a scale on which“0”means that a given entity is definitelynot alive, and“1”means that we have not the slightest doubt of it being alive. For instance,all past or present bacteria and eukarya would be attributed a value of lifeness of 1 on thisscale. This version of pluralism could be labeled as“gradualism”.
notes/Q47407732.md:All these definitions proceedgenus et differentia; they enunciate an essential propertythat delineates a larger class, and then one or several other properties which define life as asubclass of this larger class (on this method, see Malaterre’s interesting comments on thevarious methods of definition).
notes/Q47407732.md:Such a method meansthat they try to identify the essence (in any sense you wish, scholastic or phenomenological)of present terrestrial life as everyone understands it today. Although I do think that thisreflection is very much in the metaphysical mood of what Popper condemned soenergetically, I must confess that it is philosophically very interesting. Such a definitionmight well be listed as a fourth (and fascinating) philosophical definition of life, beyond thethree that we have listed above. This definition looks like a mixture of the animist (orAristotelian) definition and the organizational (or Kantian) definition.

notes/Q85632863.md:With respect to adult education, continuing education, or professional practice (S4 Appendix, Table 7), Lieberthal and Leon (2015) report on having adult health economics students post their written assignments to Wikipedia [52]. Additionally, genomics experts use and contribute to the GeneWiki, a collection of Wikipedia entries where each entry is related to a specific human gene, which aims to comprehensively annotate gene functions for each known human gene [70]. The GeneWiki has been integrated into the larger body of Wikipedia articles [70] and is presented as a solution to the previous problem biomedical researchers faced in producing review articles for each of the 20,000 human genes [71]. Further, the GeneWiki itself has been mined for its gene annotations in an effort to generate a gene ontology and a disease ontology [72]. Finally, a study from New Zealand, while citing a low participation rate, suggests that Wikipedia use by interns, residents, and consultants is common to aid with memory recall or to provide a fast overview [73].
notes/Q85632863.md:Any evaluation will remain a snapshot in time that may or may not be applicable by the time the study hits the press. Unless these studies are used to establish a plan to improve Wikipedia’s content, it is a challenge to understand their value. Studies that measure the quality of Wikipedia’s health information seem to be asking the wrong question. A more appropriate question might be “how can Wikipedia’s health information be improved?” Further, recommendations for or against the use of Wikipedia in any context based on quality do not take Wikipedia’s utility in education or research under consideration
notes/Q85632863.md:An interesting contradiction in the literature however, is that some studies find Wikipedia is appropriate for public consumption, while others deem it unsuitable for student consumption This raises the question: what makes Wikipedia suitable for patient use, but not medical student use? If the Wikipedia community aims to create a Wikipedia that is suitable for both medical students and patients, what problems may arise?

The former is to be illustrated by the way in which a gar‑ dener classifies plants, the latter by the way in which a botanist classifies them. The former is, strictly speaking, only an arrangement. The gardener arranges his plants as they are fit for food, for ornament, etc. One of his classifica‑ tions of ornamental plants is into trees, shrubs, and flowers. His object is the direct application of knowledge to utilitar‑ ian purposes. It is, so to speak, practical. The other kind of classification (the classification properly so‑called) is rather for the better organization of existing knowledge, and for discovering the relations of new facts; its princi‑ ples are methodical guides to further investigation. It is of great utilitarian value, but not directly.”

In other words, we must assume that scientific procedures have a significant logical and epistemological dimension.

notes/Q105870540.md:  Reducing abduction purely to terms of logical inference is a mistake: therefore, at least two epistemological senses can be established for the term abduction. Definition 1: the inferential process through which plausible hypotheses are generated - we can call it creative abduction. Definition 2: the inferential process through which the best explanation is established and hypotheses are evaluated - we can call it evaluative abduction (MAGNANI, 1998, p. 1,15 cited in RODRÍGUEZ, 2005, p. 93-94). 
notes/Q105870540.md:  Abduction can be understood as the inference of a case (B) from a rule (A) and a result (C). It has a poor degree of veracity or, as Peirce puts it, something may be the “case” (CP 5.171) if it is a belief accepted by inference from knowledge pre-established in the premises - i.e., rule and result. Thus, the three types of reasoning can be classified as explanatory, when they make clear what is already contained in the premises, and expansive, i.e., reasonings that increase knowledge (CP 2. 623).

notes/Q60469724.md:The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein–protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090.
notes/Q60469724.md:STRING is one of the earliest efforts (28) and strives to differentiate itself mainly through (i) high coverage, (ii) ease of use and (iii) a consistent scoring system. 
notes/Q60469724.md:Together with other online resources (including the IMEx consortium, which is one of STRING’s largest primary data sources), the STRING database has recently been awarded the status of a European Core Data Resource by ELIXIR, a pan-European bioinformatics initiative dedicated to sustainable bioinformatics infrastructure (37). As a prerequisite and consequence of this status, all interaction data and accessory information in STRING are now freely available without restrictions, under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 4.0 license.
notes/Q91006744.md:In response to the 2019 European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) AMR Databases Workshop, we have established the ‘AMR_Curation’ public repository for collective curation of AMR genes and mutations involving the majority of AMR database curators (e.g. NCBI, Resfinder, MEGARes, etc.) with an active and monitored curation issue tracker, a parallel AMR curation mailing list, editable Google Spreadsheet List of AMR Databases and Software, and curated Wikipedia list of AMR Databases all accessible at https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation.

Thus, activation of MPOA-projecting VMHvlESR1 (ESR1VMHvl→MPOA) and VMHvl-projecting MPOAESR1∩VGAT (ESR1∩VGATMPOA→VMHvl) neurons suppressed female-directed mounting and male-directed aggression, respectively, implying a reciprocal inhibitory circuit motif as previously suggested28 (Fig. 4u).

Third, the number of GABAergic cell types estimated from our scRNASeq data (Tasic et al., 2018) and morpho-electric data (Gouwens et al., 2019) collected in mouse primary visual cortex (VISp)- i.e., the number of VISp GABAergic “t-types” (60) and “me-types” (26) - dif- fers by more than a factor of two.
notes/Q102056745.md:The steps included first preparing a VISp-specific hierarchically-organized reference tree (based on transcriptomes from dissociated cells from VISp of our previous transcriptomic study), which contained 93 t-types, and choosing marker genes for the mapping - i.e., the genes that best distinguished groups at each branch of the tree. Next, we mapped Patch-seq transcriptomes to the reference tree via a bootstrap approach in which only 70% of the available genes and reference cells were used in each of 100 iterations.
notes/Q102056745.md:To test how consistent morphologies were within a t-type, we measured the correlation between an in- dividual cell’s axon histogram and the t-type average (Figure 4B). Most cells were positively correlated, indicating consistent axonal innervation patterns.
notes/Q102056745.md:We trained random forest classifiers on all 44 electrophysiology sPCs to predict either transcriptomic sub- class or t-type. The subclass classifier performed at >90% accuracy (Figure 5A), indicating that GABAergic transcriptomic subclasses have distinctive electrophysiological features.However, the t-type classifier had a prediction accuracy of 57% (Figure 5B), and prediction error rates varied considerably across t-types.

notes/Q105429450.md:Before the emergence of Wikidata, the Semantic Web generally remained technologically inaccessible to most librarians, making its adoption in libraries painstakingly slow (McKenna et al., 2018). Marshall and Shipman (2003) argue that throughout history visionaries and scientists have consistently underestimated the complexities of artificial intelligence and ensuing human-machine interactions that underpin them. By his own admission, Berners-Lee, the founder of the current web and also the visionary behind the idea of the Semantic Web, conceded that his vision of the Semantic Web remains unrealized because “the ontologies that will furnish the semantics for the Semantic Web must be developed, managed, and endorsed by practice communities.” (Shadbolt et al., 2006, p. 99). With Wikidata successfully serving as a LOD repository of facts, the vision idea of the Semantic Web no longer seems far-fetched.
notes/Q101210731.md:To test this hypothesis, we generated the first integrated human oral single cell RNA sequencing atlases to predict cellular sources of susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In situ hybridization (ISH) was used to confirm ACE2 and TMPRSS expression to epithelia of the SGs and the oral and oropharyngeal mucosae.

notes/Q47639378.md:In keeping with its primary function to list individual family members, family pages in the CAZy database are efficiently minimalistic. CAZypedia arose from the idea that a more detailed and directly accessible summary of the key research on individual CAZy families would be of significant value to glycoscience researchers, particularly highlighting the primacy of key research discoveries in a family, and supporting the activities of all scientists interested in CAZymes.
notes/Q47639378.md:Thus, although CAZypedia adopts many of the general principles and rules of Wikipedia, CAZypedia draws on best-practice authoring and editing principles of peer-reviewed, wiki-based encyclopedia such as Citizendium (available at URL http://en.citizendium.org/) and Scholarpedia (available at URL http://www.scholarpedia.org)

notes/Q28657448.md:. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companiesoffer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician orgeneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies.However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create acentral open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allowsparticipants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypicinformation. Through this crowdsourced effort of collecting genetic and phenotypic information, openSNP has become aresource for a wide area of studies, including Genome-Wide Association Studies. openSNP is hosted at http://www.opensnp.org, and the code is released under MIT-license at http://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr.
notes/Q28657448.md:GWAS are not only performed inside the traditional scientificcommunity. Since 2006, companies like 23andMe, deCODEmeor FamilyTreeDNA have been offering Direct-To-Consumer(DTC) genetic testing. These companies use DNA microarraysto screen for around 0.5 to 1 million SNPs spread over the humangenome. In return, customers receive an analysis of the results, aswell as a raw file that includes the customer’s individual genotypes.In 2011, 23andMe alone had over 100,000 customers [10].

notes/Q106272048.md: We found striking differences: children with  COVID-19  as  opposed  to  adults  had  a  higher  proportion  of  innate  lymphoid  and  non-clonally  expanded  naive  T  cells  in  peripheral  blood,  and  a  limited  interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and  describe  a  novel  inflammatory  epithelial  cell  population.
notes/Q106272048.md:Such changes in  the characteristics  of  circulating  B  cells  at  a  very  young  age  might  also  be  linked  to  the formation of structures like the marginal zone, which is not fully developed until 2 years of age66. Together our data suggests that naive T and B cells that have already entered circulation continue to develop and mature during the first year after birth.
notes/Q91665384.md:Accurate estimation of cell-type composition from gene expression data
notes/Q91665384.md:To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature.
notes/Q91665384.md:Of note, we make the commonly used simplifying assumption that the total amount of RNA is approximately equal in each cell. If this is not true, the estimated contribution of each cell type may deviate from the actual cell abundance.
notes/Q91665384.md:The single-cell data cell-type labels shown in Yan et al. Figure 5a19 were obtained from the authors upon request, and these were used to generate the signature matrix. The bulk data is quantified in terms of FPKM values.

notes/Q34555562.md:Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes consist of multiple specialized sub- types that play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation.

notes/Q34555562.md:Taken to- gether, our data suggest that AXL+SIGLEC6+ DCs are related but not identical to cDCs or pDCs.
notes/Q34555562.md:Furthermore, a murine study identified noncanonical CX3CR1+CD8a+ cDCs (nc-cDCs), which ex- press pDC and cDC signatures. These findings suggest that AS DCs are similar to human CD2hi pDCs and murine nc-cDCs.
notes/Q34555562.md:Nonetheless, some DC/monocyte subtypes were likely missed because they do not express MHC class II at rest, can onlybe defined bynon-RNAmolecules, are distinguished by low-abundance transcripts, or are onlypresent during inflammation, disease, or within tissues. To build a comprehensive im- mune cell atlas, future studies will need to address these challenges as well as localize these cell types within lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues.

notes/Q34164191.md:The alliance is itself an experiment in collaborative science. There have been relatively few large-scale collaborations in basic biology. It is a young science that has flourished to date in the hands of individual investigators, directing relatively small laboratories. But the scientific questions posed by the AfCS are not suited to the traditional distributed approach to experimental biology.

Key aspects that increase con- fidence are the use of clear, understandable and non-technical language;[2] the ability to respond to people’s concerns[3] and the regular provision and repetition of information even when there is no new scientific evidence

notes/Q772056.md:The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd.
notes/Q772056.md:We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"
notes/Q772056.md:Suppose the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for 30 digits. Then the number of states is 10 100x50x30 i.e., 10 150,000 . This is about the number of states of three Manchester machines put together.
notes/Q772056.md:But in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"
notes/Q772056.md:I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.
notes/Q772056.md:Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any improved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is made clear which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no harm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they suggest useful lines of research
notes/Q772056.md:The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are limitations to the Powers If any particular machine, it has only been stated, without any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines.

notes/Q101212121.md:Auditory processing depends upon inhibitory signaling by interneurons, even at its earliest stages in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). Remarkably, to date only a single subtype of inhibitory neuron has been documented in the VCN, a projection neuron termed the D-stellate cell. With the use of a transgenic mouse line, optical clearing, and imaging techniques, combined with electrophysiological tools, we revealed a population of glycinergic cells in the VCN distinct from the D-stellate cell.

notes/Q99564826.md:Although many kinds of analyses are possible after harmonization, many biomedical researchers are most interested in cell type annotation, i.e. the assignment of each new cell into a known cell type or novel cluster. Perhaps surprisingly, no software tool is specifically designed to assign cells to known types while clustering the unassigned cells into novel clusters.
notes/Q99564826.md:northstar assigned natural killer (NK) cells, one of the four cell types removed from the atlas, to T cells, a transcriptionally similar cell type that was still present in the atlas. An analogous mistake led to misclassification of capillary endothelial cells as fenestrated cells and to the merging of fibroblasts and mesangial cells—both mesenchymal cells—into the same novel cluster (14). Northstar misclas- sified a small number of cells to an unrelated cell type (red dots).
notes/Q99564826.md:often requires manual steps (e.g. writing emails to the authors). Cell type annotations are difficult to find and often of mediocre quality, presenting a challenge in particular to algorithms such as scClassify that rely on entire cell type hierarchies17. Although northstar is less affected because it does not require a hierarchical ontology, we aspire to change this trend by providing a website with averages and subsamples for several atlases that can be accessed both by humans and programmatically: https ://north stara tlas.githu b.io/atlas _landm arks. This makes it easy to combine atlases and cherry pick different cell types from each to maximize the leverage provided by the annotations. Contributions and requests are welcome.

notes/Q27311570.md:This mode of presentation paints the overall phenotypic landscape of cortical cell types as a combination of continuity and discreteness: the presence of a large number of intermediate cells between a particular pair of core types suggests a phenotypic continuum, whereas a lack of intermediate cells connecting one type to others suggests its more dis- crete character.

Inj, injection site; IT, injection tract; D, microdissected tissue used for preparation of single-cell suspension and FACS. Single-cell transcriptomes were obtained and used to classify the corresponding cells by the random forest approach (Online Methods) to our previously determined transcriptomic cell types
notes/Q27311570.md:Our results suggest many new directions for further investigation.
notes/Q27311570.md:At the forefront is the question of the correspondence and potential causal relationships between transcriptomic signatures and specific morphological, physiological and functional properties.
notes/Q27311570.md:Are certain transcriptomic differences representative of cell state or activity, rather than cell type? In fact, is there a clear distinction between the state and the type? For example, recent evidence suggests that Pvalb basket cells acquire specific firing properties in an activity-dependent manner that may result in a continuum of basket cell phenotypes33, perhaps mirroring the large numbers of intermediate cells that we found for upper layer Etv1(Er81)-positive Pvalb cells (Fig. 4a). Although these questions await further studies, our approach provides an overview of adult cell types in a well-defined cortical area based on a highly mul- tidimensional data set and is an essential step toward understanding the most complex animal organ, the mammalian brain.
notes/Q38862522.md:Next, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) coupled with the pathway gene set data of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was applied by pairwise comparison to explore signalling pathways potentially involved in HSC formation (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). The result by GSEA was verified by hypergeometric testing based on differentially expressed genes. Compared with ECs, there were 57 pathways overrepresented in T1 pre-HSCs (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.25; Supplementary Table 9). Notably, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathways were both overrepresented in the T1 population, implying that mitochondrial aerobic respiration was specifically activated at this stage. In contrast, quiescent HSCs reside in hypoxic bone marrow niches and rely heavily upon glycolysis for energy production.

notes/Q57945379.md:The criterion of suitable size is necessarily a vague one. Bitterns are rarer than blackbirds, but this should not motivate the attempt to divide blackbirds up into lots of geographic races about as numerous as are bitterns. Despite this vagueness, however, it is clear enough that some such desideratum is violated by the suggestion that there is only one species of deciduous oak in America, or that common types of bacteria should be divided into innumerable species the vast majority of which go extinct long before anyone bothers to distinguish them.
notes/Q57945379.md:The most plausible answer, and ultimately the one I take to be correct, is that the units of evolution are lineages. Lineages in general are sequences of entities related by ancestry and descent.

notes/Q87649649.md:Allon Klein: The concept of “cell type” is poorly defined, but useful. We focus on defining coordinates underlying “cell states.”\textbf{ Cell types have been defined by morphology, ontogeny, function, or molecular composition. No single attribute has served. Coherent patterns in single-cell data serve to define “cell states.” The hard work is relating cell states to “cell types.”.\textbf{We will also find cells that associate with two or more classical “cell types.” Cells rest on a continuum manifold of cell state, cell type divisions are artificial.
notes/Q87649649.md:Ed Lein: The concept of “cell type” reduces complexity. A neuronal type could be a genetically encoded circuit element, while an elegant taxonomy should reflect cells’ developmental origin, connectivity, and function.

notes/Q104450645.md:Initial  uniform  samplingwill  be  performed  to  profile  a  defined  number  of  cells, k,  from  a specimen with minimal, if any, additional stratification. The number of cells to be profiled must be determined based on a statistical model. An early example (Box 1) accounts for the number of cell  types  expected  in  the  tissue,  the  proportion  of  the  rarest  type  that  we  desire  to  detect,  the minimal  number  of  cells  desired of the  rarest  type,
notes/Q104450645.md:Data organization in the atlas.This includes discovery and taxonomy of the different cell types and their relationships, including formally addressing the fundamental question “What  is  a  cell type?” The Atlas will be organized using multiple complementary maps and coordinate systems: spatial  and  molecular  systems  followed  by  functional,  physiological,  and  lineage-derived  maps. A key challenge will be to generate these maps and to understand how they relate to one another. To  do  so,  we  will  need  to  develop  methods  to  link  different  layers  (including  data  generated using  very  different  technologies)  and  understand  common  features.  This  will  shed  light  on  the relationship between phenotype and function.
notes/Q104450645.md:Defining  a  cell  type  and  organization  of  the  atlas.A  primary  goal  in  creating  the  HCA  is  to define  cell  types  and  to  characterize  their  biological  roles.  A  data-driven  approach  to  this challenge   takes   single-cell   measurements   and provides a   grouping   of   cells   into   distinct subpopulations   (i.e.,   clusters).   Specifically,   each   cell   is   represented   as   a   point   in   high-dimensional  space  (molecular  phenotype),where  clustering  is  tantamount  to  finding  dense regions  of  similar  cells  in  this  space.  Numerous  computational  methods  exist  for  this  task,  but their relativemerits have not been fully assessed. As spatial data accumulate, methods should be developed  that  integrate  spatial  and  molecular  data  toward  more  accurate  cataloging  of  cell types.  Cell type definition. Before an optimal clustering algorithm can be selected, the notion of a cell type  must  be  formally  defined.  Currently,  a  cell  type  implies  significant  phenotypic  and functional stability over time, achieved perhaps through epigenetic regulation. While a cell typesuggests  a  discrete  entity,  recent  data  sets  are  highlighting  that  many presumed cell  types actually form  part  of  a  continuum.  For  example,  a  T  cell  can  exist  in  different  states  (mitotic, activated)  while  maintaining  its  identity  as  a  T  cell,  and  T  cell  activation  is  considered  as  a continuum,  rather  than  as  two  discrete  modes.  Stable  cell  types  encompass  many  states  and, therefore,  exist  in  a  diverse  but  restricted  set  of  the  high-dimensional  phenotype  space. Epigenetic  data  modalities  such  as  ATAC-Seq  will  help  distinguish  cell  types  from  cell states (Section 2 and Section 3).
notes/Q104450645.md:Consequently, clustering algorithms need to find salient features of more stable cell types and distinguish cell-type variations from those associated with physiological states (such as cell   cycle),   as   well   as   to   model   continuous   trajectories   where   these   exist.   Thus,   new computational  methods  will  be  required  both  to  discover  types  and  to  better  classify  cells.  As these develop, they  will  ultimately refine the very  concepts of  cell type and state. Additionally, understanding the relationship between cell types and establishing new cell-type taxonomies will be critical. To achieve this, the AWG will coordinate with HCA subgroups to establish a series ofbenchmark data sets that can be used to determine effective similarity metrics and assess the performance of different methods

Assuming that cells were sampled in an unbiased manner, dense regions along a trajectory indicate preferred transcriptomic states.

We can find these metastable states by plotting histograms of the pseudotime coordinate.

notes/Q107425133.md:When adding new instances to Wikidata, contributorsmust specify descriptive values for the taxonomy relations ofinstance of (P31)andsubclass of (P279). This fact, togetherwith Wikidata’s fairly wide ontology (containing millions ofclasses) and the difficulty of representing is-a relationships,raises the question: can the community distinguish classesfrom instances? Our analysis of removed statements withobject properties reveals nearly half a million cases whereone of the taxonomic relations has been changed to theother, which point to the fact that the community strugglesto decide whether to use instance-of (P31) or subclass-of(P279) to model inheritance in Wikidata.1

notes/Q46326031.md:Overall, the enterprise of cell‑type classification has the potential to transform our view of nervous system function and malfunction. Many problems remain, and, as is the case for species taxonomy, cell‑type classification schemes need to be regarded as hypotheses to be tested and refined as we move through these stages. Nonetheless, the pace of progress is rapid, and some of the conceptual and technical challenges that seem formidable today are likely to be surmounted over the next decade.

notes/Q59770872.md:After curating a set of marker genes from the literature corresponding to expected cell types (Table S1), we estimated their activity scores in each of the 85 clusters. This enabled the assignment of 51 clusters to a specific cell type.
notes/Q59770872.md:An open question is whether cell types distributed throughout the body exhibit tissue-specific chromatin architecture. We first investigated this question by focusing on endothelial cells. Although definitive annotation will require further work, these data reveal that endothelial cells have specialized patterns of chromatin accessibility within and between tissues.
notes/Q59770872.md:As similar single-cell atlases of chromatin accessibility are generated and made available for humans and other species, we anticipate rich opportunities for investigating the evolution of cell-type-specific cis-acting regulatory ele- ments, the evolution (or death thereof) of the trans-acting regu- latory milieu within each cell type, and the birth and death of individual cell types (Arendt et al., 2016).
notes/Q92043520.md:Interesting visuzlizations.
notes/Q94954393.md:On the other hand, since scientific interest in ncR-NAs is more recent, and so fewer articles describingtheir  roles  in  cellular  events  have  been  publishedto date, our second objective was to annotate everyarticle  we  could  find,  which  described  an  interac-tion between a miR and the mRNA transcript of aprotein-coding  gene  from  the  priority  list  (Supple-mentary Table 1).
notes/Q33664675.md:The peritoneal cavity (PerC) is a unique compartment within whicha variety of immune cells reside, and from which macrophages(MØ) are commonly drawn for functional studies. Here we definetwo MØ subsets that coexist in PerC in adult mice. One, provision-ally called the large peritoneal MØ (LPM), contains approximately90% of the PerC MØ in unstimulated animals but disappears rap-idly from PerC following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or thioglycolatestimulation
notes/Q33664675.md:SPM  and  LPM  Are  Present  in  All  Mouse  Strains  Tested.SPMs andLPMs are detectable in PerC from all of the strains analyzed inthis study, including BALB/c, C57BL/6, 129/S6, FVB/N, SJL/J,and RAG−/−(Fig. S4). The relatively constant frequencies ofthese subsets in PerC, and their similar proportionality amongnon-B PerC leukocytes suggests that there may be an evolu-tionary advantage to maintenance of the composition of theapparently free-living peritoneal leukocytes.
notes/Q106630248.md:These KBs contain almost onlypositivestate-ments, and this is engraved in theopen-world assumption(OWA)employed on theSemantic Web, which states that asserted state-ments aretrue, while the remainder isunknown.
notes/Q106630248.md:Deleted Statements.Having access to the history of edits inWikidata may offer promising candidates for negative informa-tion [31], namely by investigating the statements that were oncepart of a KB but got subsequently deleted (possible candidate forgrounded negative statements)
notes/Q106630248.md:On a random sample of 1kdeleted statements, over 82% were just caused by ontology modifi-cations, granularity changes, rewordings, or prefix modifications,such as:(Ghandi; lifestyle; Vegetarian)changed toVegetarian-ismand(James Green; oxfordID; 101011386)changed to11386.15% were statements that were actually restored a year later, andthe remaining 3% represented actual negation, yet we found them tobe rarelynoteworthy, i.e., presenting mostly things like correctionsof birth dates or location updates reflecting geopolitical changes.
notes/Q106630248.md:.Erroneous changes can also be di-rectly recorded via the deprecated rank feature [18], asgroundednegative statements. However, we found that this mostly relatesto errors coming from various import sources, and its focus isnot mainly materializinginterestingnegations like that“StephenHawking did not win the Nobel Prize in Physics.”.

Or dropping the statement¬(DouglasAdams; occupation; author)because he is awriter. Thesame goes for awards (Academy Award) and instances ofawards (Academy Award for Best Actor,Best Actress, etc.)

notes/Q19671659.md:In this usecase, we describe thevarious parts and relationships within a scientific investigation. A sci- entific ‘experiment’ (Figure 9) is a ‘procedure’ that aims to support, dispute or refute a well formulated ‘hypothesis’ by ‘analysis’ of ‘data’ obtained through ‘observation’ and/or ‘measurement’.
notes/Q43299861.md:We screened the retinas of 536 mouse lines generated in the GENSAT project. We observed stratum- or cell type–restricted GFP labeling in 100 mouse lines. 
notes/Q43299861.md:There are few well-studied amacrine cell types8,9 with characteristic morphology and defined function for which immunohistochemical markers are available. We tested whether those distinct cell types are present and uniquely labeled in our mouse catalog.
notes/Q43299861.md:stratum. Using this principle, we searched for GENSAT mouse lines with labeled cells that are potentially connected. We searched for mouse lines where at least one GFP-positive IPL stratum was the same as the dendritic stratification of a ganglion cell type of interest labeled in another mouse line (query pattern; Fig. 6c).
notes/Q36854753.md:lineage analysis has contributed relatively little beyond identifying two daughter cell types (neurons and glia) generated from embryonic neuroepithelial stem cells and their regionalization patterns in neural plate, tube, and crest (Brown et al., 2001).
notes/Q36854753.md:there is not even a satisfactory definition of neuron cell type, with terms like “class”, “subclass”, “type”, and “subtype” often used interchangeably without proper definition (Cook, 1998; Masland, 2004). Obviously, a systematic account of neuron cell types is a prerequisite for establishing the nervous system's basic wiring diagram and determining the functional significance of molecular mechanisms in specific circuit elements.
notes/Q36854753.md:Polythetic neuron classification schemas are best regarded not as cell type definitions, but instead as hypotheses that cell taxa fulfill distinct functional roles (Rowe and Stone, 1977). Viewing neuron classifications as hypotheses is advantageous because they can be tested with more data or new methods, then changed accordingly or discarded (Cook, 1998; Rowe and Stone, 1977).
notes/Q36854753.md:The next hierarchy level, neuron classes occupies a transitional place in terms of monothetic and polythetic classification—neuron classes in this scheme are found in highly differentiated regions and are established across species (e.g., all vertebrates, or all mammals). They are usually determined monothetically, although polythetic analyses also refer to them.
notes/Q36854753.md:Parameters included in each criterion and subcriterion were derived from the original literature, as well as various attempts to classify neurons, such as the guidelines of the “Pettila Convention”. Taxonomic relations established between terms in BAMS's Neuron ontology can be documented already by any combination of more than 100 criteria and parameters, which are readily extensible.
notes/Q36854753.md:Complexities of the neuron classification problem, combined with the existence of alternate neuron nomenclatures for the same neural region or subsystem, make ontologies necessary tools for the explicit specification of concepts (Gruber, 1993) and for mapping or indexing between terms. Cell ontologies have been developed as components of larger bioinformatics (Gene Ontology Database [Ashburner and Lewis, 2002; Bard et al., 2005], DopaNet [Le Novère et al., 2004]) and anatomy ontologies (Rosse and Mejino, 2003), and other cell ontologies are available as well online (Cell Type: http://www.sanbi.ac.za/evoc/ontologies_html/latest/celltype.html; TissueDB: http://tissuedb.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp: 8082/tissuedb/), but none are designed specifically for the nervous system.
notes/Q31033187.md:Through acute pharmacological probing of cortical interneurons, we established causality between RNA- seq–based predictions and experimentally observed neuronal responses ex vivo. 
notes/Q31033187.md:As reliable histochemical detection of CCK+ interneurons is particularly challenging, we established a dual-labeled CCKBAC/dsRed::GAD67gfp/+ mouse reporter23,24 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a), and sampled dual DsRed+/GFP+ interneurons in layers (L)1/2 of the somatosensory cortex.

notes/Q31033187.md:receptor 3a (Htr3a) subtype to detect and classify CCK interneurons4,41. In our Patch-seq data set, we observed no 5-HT3a expression in I-type 1 cells (Fig. 6a,c), low Htr3a mRNA expression in I-type 2 (Calb+/Npy+/Vip−) cells and high mRNA copy numbers in I-type 3 (Vip+/Npy−) and I-type 4 (Vip+/Npy+, Fig. 6b,c) and I-type 5 (Vip−/Npy+) interneurons. This suggests that Htr3a expression among CCK+ interneurons might be more restricted than initially thought, likely leading to the undersampling of CCK interneurons by Htr3a-driven genetic tags41
notes/Q31033187.md:e further showed that Patch-seq can identify a select number of molecular determinants that can be used to further subdivide CCK+ interneuron subclasses. Each of these examples is important because theyreconcile previously reported sets of data on receptors (5Ht3a, Cnr1) and channels (Hcn1) (refs. 3,6,7,39–41). We note that Patch-seq can discover sets of cellular markers independent of other classification systems or a priori knowledge of the cell type of interest.

notes/Q104161380.md:In 2006, Kai Wang, then a bioinformatics graduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle, wrote a letter to Nature 5 urging the community to create wiki-based gene annotation tools. Now a postdoc at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Wang says he has not yet contributed to any of the new wikis. “There are too many of them to invest a lot of time to test drive every single one of them.
notes/Q86916694.md:It has been argued that a high ge- netic relatedness (r) between cells played a pivotal role in the evolutionary transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms, because it leads to reduced conflict and an alignment of interests between cells [1–17].
notes/Q86916694.md:We tested this hy- pothesis with a comparative study, comparing the form of multicellularity in species where groups are clonal (r=1) to species where groups are potentially nonclonal
notes/Q86916694.md:Obligate multicellularity is feasible in species with nonclonal group formation—all it requires is that cells always aggregate to complete a necessary part of their life cycle (i.e., not just under certain conditions). Given that we found no evidence for nonclonal organisms having evolved obligate multicellularity, this suggests that the genetic conflict that arises from lower relatedness (r % 1) inhibits this major transition in individuality
notes/Q31090008.md:Crucial for this expansion process are (i) the ability of assigning formal semantic labels to public samples (semantic annotation; for example, determining the targeted protein, the investigated disease state and tissue type), and (ii) the possibility of relating different samples through these labels (semantic similarity), to identify semantically coherent experiments that are suitable to be associated to the initial data set.

notes/Q42013239.md:We find that the causal impact is strong, with Wikipedia influencingroughly one in every∼830 words in related scientific journal articles. We also find causalevidence that the scientific articles referenced in Wikipedia receive more citations, suggestingthat Wikipedia complements the traditional journal system by pointing researchers to keyunderlying scientific articles.
notes/Q42013239.md:Wikipedia is one of the largest informational public goods providers for science. It is freely available,easily accessible, and is the 5thmost visited website in the world (Alexa 2017)
notes/Q42013239.md:Based on spot testing in Chemistry, we find that Wikipedia covers more than 90% of the topicsdiscussed at the undergraduate level at top-tier research universities, and about half of those covered at theintroductory graduate level.
notes/Q42013239.md:To establish thecausalimpact of Wikipedia, we performed an experiment. We commissioned subjectmatter experts to create new Wikipedia articles on scientific topics not covered in Wikipedia. These newly-created articles were randomized, with half being added to Wikipedia and half being held back as a controlgroup.2If Wikipedia shapes the scientific literature, then the text from the treatment group articles shouldappear more often in the scientific literature than the text from the control articles. We find exactly that;the word-usage patterns from the treatment group show up more in the prose in the scientific literature thando those from the control group and that these effects are large.
notes/Q42013239.md:In this paper we test several of the implications about public goods in science, in particular (i) is Wikipediaused to inform academic research, (ii) does it generate demand for the underlying papers, and (iii) are thosewith less access to journals more likely to benefit
notes/Q42013239.md:There exists substantial interest in the open-source committee for continuing to deepen the scientificknowledge on Wikipedia (Shafee et al., 2017)
notes/Q42013239.md:1Surprisingly, this is in fact a cyclic graph. However, it can be pared down to a tree using a small number of edge deletions. Inparticular, we calculate the PageRank of each node (category) in this graph and eliminate edges from low PageRank nodesto high PageRank nodes. This eliminates only 1% of nodes and renders the graph acyclic (a tree).
notes/Q42013239.md:To help put this finding in context, we can compare it with another effect: the change in the academicliterature that arises when a scientific journal publishes a review article. Figure 14 compares these, showingthe observational effect from the Wikipedia article and a comparable line for review articles. The latteris calculated by re-running of the observational analysis, but substituting contemporaneous review articles,instead of Wikipedia articles, as the treatment.16These curves suggest that the effect on the scientific literature from a Wikipedia article is similar, butweaker, to the effect from a review article. Interestingly, both are notably different from the effect of non-review journal article (not shown), which show relatively little effect.
notes/Q42013239.md:e have hypothesized that Wikipedia acts like a review article, in that it discusses topics broadly andaccessibly, referencing primary sources as the scientific support.  In this section we explore whether thescientific articles referenced in our Wikipedia article receive more citations as a result of being randomlyassigned into being posted to Wikipedia. There is significant potential for this effect, as “Wikipedia is the6thhighest referrer of DOI links (the unique hyperlinks assigned to academic articles)” (AOASG, 2017)
notes/Q42013239.md:or example, if we required grantees to edit / write a Wikipedia article, thisinitiative would essentially be a tax on their time (or their students’). The key question is how high a taxwould be needed, and whether it would be justified by the social benefit of the additional dissemination ofknowledge.
notes/Q42013239.md:n our sample the average Chemistry article in our sample has∼3,900words, and thus 3,900 words of influence is the maximum influence that an article could have. We now haveboth the cost of disseminating information and the influence is has, and thus we get our (rough) estimate ofthe cost as$220,000∗13,900= $0.56per word

notes/Q38520561.md:We emphasize that our approach, which draws on [15] and applies the ideas of geospatial dynamics  worked  out  in  that  paper  to  the  domain  of  biomedical  ontology,  consists  in  devising  a  formal  (domain  neutral)  ontology  which  can  then  be  applied  in  successively  more restricted domains. In this way, we secure clear foundations for a unified treatment of reality.  We  have  laid  what  we  believe  is  a  firm  ground  for  the  specification  of  adequate  ontologies  of  the  biomedical  domain.  It  remains  to  provide  a  more  detailed  (and  formal)  treatment of the categories and relations here surveyed

notes/Q26253934.md:established cellular markers dominates the current literature, and expression patterns of many genes remain uncharacterized
notes/Q26253934.md:of all cells, we examined the genes with the greatest percentage of expressing cells. Although true ubiquity cannot be established with- out a nuclear counter stain, genes with ‘near ubiquity’ can be vali- dated by visual confirmation of expression in essentially all cells relative to Nissl staining. A total of 186 of the top 500 genes showed detectable expression in all cell classes, although very few genes (for example, example, 2610002F03Rik and Fbxo22; Fig. 3) are expressed at high levels in all easily definable cell types (neurons, astrocytes, oligoden- drocytes, choroid plexus, ependymal lining of ventricles and pial surface). A much larger set of genes appears to be expressed in all cells but at very low levels in some cellular populations.
notes/Q26253934.md:Enriched expression in major cell types. A targeted search for genes enriched in major cell classes with distinctive anatomical localization is enabled by the atlas grid coordinate system superimposed on each gene’s expression pattern. These coordinates enable searches for genes having similar expression patterns to genes of interest. Seeding with oligodendrocyte-specific genes (Mbp, Mobp, Cnp1) returns a large set of oligodendrocyte-enriched genes; seeding with choroid-plexus-enriched genes (Col8a2, Lbp, Msx1) returns a large set of choroid-enriched genes. Where spatial distributions of cell classes overlap greatly, such as for neurons and astrocytes, this strat- egy is less robust but can still be effective. Essentially all well-estab- lished markers for different cell types were identified with these informatics-based methods for prediction followed by expert confirmation.
notes/Q104079663.md:One of the earliest and largest literature corpora created to support COVID-19 text mining is the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19, https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19) [98], a corpus of metadata and full text of COVID-19 publications and preprints released daily by Semantic Scholar at the Allen Institute for AI. PDFs are converted into machine- readable JSON using the S2ORC pipeline described in [54]and HTML representations of tables in papers are added using IBM Watson Discovery’s Global Table Extractor [115].
notes/Q104079663.md:The CovidGraph(https:// covidgraph.org/) is perhaps the largest of these, combining literature, case statistics and genomic and molecular data. Another project, the Knowledge Graph Toolkit [36], integrates the CORD-19 corpus with gene, chemical, disease and taxonomic information from Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/
notes/Q104079663.md:Among the systems that leverage KBs, those that use curated domain-specific KBs tend to provide a better user experience, since the entities and relations in these KBs have been vetted by domain experts. IBM Watson’s COVID-19 Navigator (Row S14, https://covid-19-navigator.mybluemix.net/), perhaps the best example of this, allows users to perform boolean queries using UMLS concepts and semantic types [9].
notes/Q104079663.md:Summarization systems aim to provide a condensed version of a longer piece of text.

notes/Q102929379.md:An ontology is a set of precise descriptive statements about some part of the world (usually referred to as the domain of interest or the subject matter of the ontology). Precise descriptions satisfy several purposes: most notably, they prevent misunderstandings in human communication and they ensure that software behaves in a uniform, predictable way and works well with other software.
notes/Q102929379.md:OWL 2 is not a programming language: OWL 2 is declarative, i.e. it describes a state of affairs in a logical way. Appropriate tools (so-called reasoners) can then be used to infer further information about that state of affairs. The correct answer to any such question is predetermined by the formal semantics (which comes in two versions: the Direct Semantics [OWL 2 Direct Semantics] and the RDF-Based Semantics [OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics])
notes/Q102929379.md:The complement of a class corresponds to logical negation: it consists of exactly those objects which are not members of the class itself. The following definition of childless persons uses the class complement and also demonstrates that class constructors can be nested. (owl:complementOf).
notes/Q102929379.md:Property restrictions provide another type of logic-based constructors for complex classes. As the name suggests, property restrictions use constructors involving properties. This means that there is an expectation that for every instance of Parent, there exists at least one child, and that child is a member of the class Person

notes/Q35185544.md:These observations raised several questions about the causes and roles of single-cell variability during the innate immune response: How does variability change during the response? Do different stimuli elicit distinct variation patterns, especially in stimulus-relevant pathways? Does cell-to-cell communication promote or restrain heterogeneity? Addressing these requires profiling large numbers of cells from diverse conditions and genetic perturbations

notes/Q28606409.md:--> Link working, interesting platform.
notes/Q28606409.md:Publishing information is meaningful only if there is enough supporting information for reproducing them. For example Ioannidis et al., pointed out that they could not reproduce the majority of the 18 articles they investigated describing results from microarray experiments, includ- ing selected tables and figures [21].Nanopublication does not guarantee full reproducibility, but as a model for com- bining data with attribution and provenance in a digital format it at least makes it possible to trace the origin of scientific results.

notes/Q58611639.md:We curated the literature to keep RegulonDB up to date, and initiated curation of ChIP and gSELEX experiments. We estimate that current knowledge describes between 10% and 30% of the expected total number of transcription factor- gene regulatory interactions in E. coli. RegulonDB provides datasets for interactions for which there is no evidence that they affect expression, as well as expression datasets.
notes/Q58611639.md:We recently reported curation of close to 50 publications based on HT methodologies including gSELEX and various ChIP (exo, chip, seq) experiments (4). Our work focused essentially in extracting those bound sites with enough information (sequence in the genome, as well as evidence of the effect on the downstream gene) to be identified as regulatory interactions.

notes/Q98208987.md:Most current approaches use the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for annotating the set of phenotypic abnormalities observed in the individual being investigated by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. The HPO contains 14,813 terms arranged as a directed acyclic graph in which edges represent subclass relations; 13,182 of these terms represent phenotypic abnormalities. For instance, Abnormal renal cortex morphology (HP:0011035) is a subclass of Abnormal renal morphology (HP:0012210)

notes/Q105870679.md:Since the biomedical domain most likely represents the knowledgedomain that contains the largest number of ontologies, two or moreontologies in this domain may use (slightly) different terms to representbasically the same concept or may even duplicate an existing concept.Thus, in order to identify a suitable set of concepts to be used as basisfor the semantic transformation in our case study, we have primarilyfocused on the set of ontologies standardized and maintained by theOBO Foundry1
notes/Q105870679.md:Nice detailing of the different competency questions.
notes/Q107363147.md:For example, different cell types can be assigned using existing ontologies/nomenclatures based on genetic, protein, or other biomarker expression profiles. Rapid progress on single-cell technologies has led to an explosion of cell-type definitions, but no standards exist for the naming of anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers across organ systems (but see20). Furthermore, information on what cell types are commonly found in which anatomical structures and what biomarkers best characterize certain cell types is scattered across hundreds of ontologies (e.g., Uberon multi-species anatomy ontology, Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology [FMA], Cell Ontology [CL], or HUGO Gene Nomenclature) and thousands of publications (e.g., see atlas efforts for brain21, heart22, lung22, and kidney12) on cells identified during human development, disease, and across multiple species.

notes/Q29617430.md:Here we use single-cell RNAsequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mousebone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysacchar-ide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal vari-ation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, whichwe validate by RNA-fluorescencein situhybridization for selecttranscripts.
notes/Q27943213.md:. Previously observed variants indbSNP129 [18], the 1000 Genomes Project [19], orHapMap were  excluded. PolyPhen  predictions [20]were used to prioritize variants that were predicted tobe  damaging.  This  process  undoubtedly  involveddownloading, parsing, and analyzing annotation datafrom multiple databases, representing a significant in-vestment of time and effort.Using the MyGene.info and MyVariant.info R packagesalone, we are able to implement an updated version of thispipeline: about 50 lines of code, requiring no local installa-tion of variant annotation databases or software tools (seeFig. 2, [21], and Additional file 2: Supplementary Note 1).

notes/Q28256189.md: studying the behavior of large, randomly con- structed nets of these binary “genes”. The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior.
notes/Q28256189.md: ary device, able only to be on or off. The most fundamental of measures is the binary category scale. Use of these simplest devices facilitates study of the behavior of truly complex nets; the behavior of randomly connected, but then fixed, nets of binary components should provide a reliable guide to the behavior of similar systems whose components’ behavior are described by continuous or probabilistic functions; synthesis of mRNA  is, in fact, probably an all or none binary process; the number of repressor molecules per gene is thought to be less than about 12 (Bretscher, 1967), therefore it seems preferable to treat the activity of a gene as a discrete, not continuous, function of its input. 
notes/Q28256189.md:e principles underlying cellular differentiation remain among the most enigmatic in biology. We are required to explain the spontaneous generation of a multiplicity of cell types from the single zygote, to deduce a natural tendency of a system to become increasingly heterogeneous, then to stop differentiating. Among the important characteristics of cell differentiation are: initiation of change; stabilization of change after cessation of stimulus; the efficacy of many substances, exogenous and endogenous, as inductive stimuli; a limit of five or six as the number of cell types which may differentiate directly from any cell type; progressive limitation in the number of developmental path- ways open to any small region of the embryo; restricted periods during which a cell is competent to respond to an inductive stimulus; the discreteness of cell types, that is, the mutually exclusive constellations of properties by which cells differ; a requirement for a minimal and preferably heterogeneous cell mass to initiate differentiation in many instances, and to maintain it in some; the occurrence of metaplasia between undifferentiated cell types, or from an undifferentiated type to a specialized type, but the lack of metaplasia (the isolation) between specialized cell types; and the cessation of differentia- tion (Grobstein, 1959).

notes/Q56815361.md:Characterizing a protein in human tissues is often difficult due to sample access restrictions and most functional  studies  are  performed  on  cell  lines,  which  only  partially  reproduce in  vivo  conditions. Although  new  technologies  of  targeted  genome  editing  accelerate  initial  steps  in  protein characterization,  understanding  the  function(s)  of  each  protein  in  its  biological  context  requires discrete,  often  time-consuming  studies.
notes/Q56815361.md:This proportion (26%) is much higher than for all PE1-4 entries in neXtProt (9%). Lack of conservation  in  mouse  may  be  one  of  the  reasons  why  some  proteins  still  lack  functional characterization. However, according to MouseMine knock-out mice have been established for 144 of the 1,353 genes with mapping to MGI (T able S3, column L). Combining the observed phenotypes with information from neXtProt can help to build or refine functional hypotheses, as will be discussed in the next sections.

More specifically, each nucleus is given an identity score that is equal to the percentage of genes that are expressed from a cell-class specific gene list. The gene lists used to classify nuclei are based on the literature [36, 63], modified, and are provided (Additional file 2: Table S1).

notes/Q96307475.md: Another factor is the belief that the data will speak for itself through computational analyses without the need for prior theories, models or hypotheses (Kitchin 2014). Although the claims of a new and “theory-free” science generating knowledge from Big Data have been questioned by both scientists and philosophers of science (e.g., Kitchin 2014; Leonelli 2016), there are still enough changes taking place to warrant the label “data intensive” science.
notes/Q96307475.md:    The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness

notes/Q49192555.md:A single neuron may be classified by structure (pseudo-bipolar), electrophysiology (spiking), neurotransmitter (glutamatergic), sensory modality (secondary olfactory neuron), location(s) within the brain (antennal lobe projection neuron, mushroom body extrinsic neuron), etc. But manually maintaining these multiple axes of classification simply doesn’t scale: adding new terms requires (human) edi- tors to know all of the appropriate classifications to add and how to rearrange existing classifications to fit the new term. It also requires them to understand the intent behind existing manually asserted classifications, which is typically partially documented at best.

notes/Q89759189.md:We applied the recently developed reduced Google Matrix (REGOMAX) algorithm in order to extract the network of hidden functional connections between proteins in Wikipedia. In this network we discovered tight communities which reflect areas of interest in molecular biology or medicine and can be considered as definitions of biological functions shaped by collective intelligence.
notes/Q89759189.md:Hidden protein links are explained by the existence of connected Wikipedia page sequences (paths) of hyperlinks through the rest of the Wikipedia network that connect two protein pages
notes/Q89759189.md:The shortest path length itself, however, is not a good measure of hidden link between two nodes of the graph, since it does not reflect the global topology of the Wikipedia network, e.g., the total number of shortest paths, connecting two nodes. By contrast, the weight of the link, estimated through the application of the reduced Google matrix, reflects the global topology of the rest of network and the probability to arrive from one protein page to an other one via a random walk with restart through the rest of the graph.
notes/Q89759189.md:Altogether, these observations indicate increasing integration of the Gene Wiki project into the global Wikipedia context, a trend which will certainly persist in the future. It remains an interesting question what can be a practical use of of the protein function definition derived from the Wikipedia structure. Another interesting question is how to use the insights obtained from analysing the topology of hidden protein connections, in order to guide further evolution of the Gene Wiki project. For example, it would be interesting to identify missing biological functions or topics which do not yet form tight clusters in the Wikipedia network
notes/Q104415799.md:For example, if a mention of “Michael Jordan” refers to the computer scientist rather than the basketball player, then we would expect a mention of “Monte Carlo” in the same document to refer to the statistical technique rather than the location.

To date, this is the largest biomedical text similarity resource that has been manually judged, evaluated and made publicly available to the community to foster research and development of text similarity algorithms.
notes/Q91566046.md:Our general interest is in finding sentences closely related to a sentence provided by a user as a query to a large repository of sentences. One approach to this problem would be to ask for sentences that have the same meaning as the query text. This is known as semantic textual similarity (25, 26). 
notes/Q91566046.md:Why should we think the alpha weight is a useful weight for retrieval of sentences? Our examination of a good deal of data computed in this way has convinced us that the most semantically meaningful terms receive the highest alpha weights.
notes/Q91566046.md:For those PubMed articles where we were able to access the full text (32%), we used the full text; for the rest we used their PubMed title and abstract.

notes/Q107332851.md:Consistent with the identification of cluster g3 as a cochlear cell type, differential gene expression analysis showed that genes highly expressed in cluster g3 compared to the rest of the cells include the gene set characteristic of cochlear GPs, including Gata2 and Npy
notes/Q107332851.md:Despite the fact that DRG and cochlear GPs are molecularly distinct, we found that NMSCs and MSCs from these two ganglia cluster together and are intermingled (Figures 4F, G). This suggests that even though Schwann cells arise from unique GPs and reside in different ganglia, their gene expression profile and function are remarkably uniform. 
notes/Q107332851.md:In stark contrast to the uniformity between Schwann cells from the two ganglia, SG and DRG satellite glia diverge significantly beyond this core set of signature genes.  Although SG satellite glia can be recognized by the presence of known markers, Glul/GS and Kcnj10/Kir4.1 (Figures 5A, 5B), these genes are not restricted to satellite glia in the literature or in our dataset (Chen and Zhao, 2014; Hanani, 2005; Liu et al., 2014).

notes/Q106121070.md:Este artigo tem como objetivo apresentar um método que estabelece princípios para sistematização do processo de criação de definições padronizadas, as quais possam para proporcionar a esperada comunicação entre sistema de informação médicos, e, portanto, melhor atendimento ao cidadão. A criação e teste do método foi conduzido no domínio das leucemias, no âmbito do projeto Blood Ontology. 
notes/Q106121070.md: Na Ciência da Informação(CI)a teoria clássica sobre definições foi preconizada pela alemã Ingetraut Dahlberg por meio da Teoria do Conceitocomo uma questão importante na construção  dos  Tesauros  (DAHLBERG,  1978a,b).  Para Dahlberg  (1978a,p.6)as definições apresentam  uma  função  importante  na  formulação  dos  conceitos,  pois  “são  pressupostos indispensáveis  na  argumentação  e  nas  comunicações  verbais  e  que  constituem  elementos necessários na construção de sistemas científicos”.
notes/Q106121070.md:esmo  com  a  existência  de  tais  recomendações  na  literatura,  diversos  problemas persistem  quando  se  definem termos  de  um  domínio  complexo  com  a  medicina.

notes/Q106121070.md:Para  propor  um métodoparaformulação  de  definições  em  linguagem  natural,apropriadas  a  ontologias  de  sistemas  de  informação  biomédicos,  estudou-se  o  caso  das Leucemias   Mieloides   Agudas   (LMAs)   no   âmbito   de   projeto Blood   Ontology(BLO) (ALMEIDA  et  al.,  2013).  A  BLO  éum  vocabulário  formal  abrangendo  o  conhecimento  em hematologia e hemoterapia, que objetiva reunir, organizar e facilitar a manipulação de dados sobre  sangue  humano.

notes/Q104450621.md:. Very few NK cells were detected, and thesewere transcriptionally most similar to the TSP2 subset. We certainly did not see any branch of developing NK cells from ETPs or T-lineage specified cells, suggesting that the residual NK-lineagepotential in these cells results from the similar transcriptional networks that drive their development(De Obaldia and Bhandoola, 2015)​, rather than being an actual event that occurs in the thymus. Whilethe lack of NK cell development is surprising, this finding is however consistent with observations inSCID patients that reconstituted T cells but failed to develop NK cells following HSC transplantation,without adverse effects.

notes/Q21145382.md:Another important early step is potentially time-consuming, but of great importance: sitting down with a large set of potential inputs and examining them by hand. Scientists without linguistic training are often amazed at the range of linguistic possibilities for expressing even the most apparently simple biological concepts. Four hours spent with a pile of articles and a highlighter may forestall many unpleasant surprises.

notes/Q93086971.md:Ultimately, cell identity is best defined by function. One powerful method for investigating cell function involves the physical elimination of cells, followed by observation of any physiological or behavioral impact on the organism.
notes/Q93086971.md:understanding the origins ofa cell’s identity, its developmental lineage, is a powerful and simple way to position a cell within a much more complex hierarchy. At a minimum, the new cell species can then be connected to its nearest relatives to provide further clues as to its role in the organism. Can, then, developmental origins alone provide sufficient information to define cell identity?
notes/Q106498418.md:You can consider putting off data sharing tasks as incurring a form of ‘sharing debt’, by analogy with the concept of technical debt used in software engineering. Delaying these tasks may appear to save you time in the short run, but sharing the data later will take at least as much time as doing it now. You may also incur interest, as it can take longer in the long run to handle individual requests for data availability. Taking a few hours now to organize data and submit it to a repository will save you much of this time.
notes/Q106498418.md:Certain organizational tactics make data much more interpretable and reduce errors. Broman & Woo [[43]] and Ellis & Leek [[44]] provide excellent suggestions on how to organize tabular data. First, ensure that you use the same labels in all areas of your data. For example, inconsistent sex labels, such as ‘female’
notes/Q21136172.md:We suggest that the application of realism results in ontologies that are over-complex, awkward or limited; as such, realism falls far short of its aim of increasing the fitness-for-purpose of ontologies.
notes/Q21136172.md: We suggest from this analysis that it is necessary, if unfortunate, for some qualities to be explicitly described with multiple representations. To avoid confusion, the universal quality, colour, would need to be explicitly described as having multiple valid models. Yet, realism argues that we should not do this, as colour is real and not a model; more over, the focus on realism means that the documentation does not describe the choices that have been made, nor refer to the relationship between Color Hue (PATO:0000015) and “Hue as in HSV”. In short, realism has limited our ability to represent colour.
notes/Q21136172.md:The Newtonian view of the world is the best model in this case: it is good enough. When building an ontology for biomedicine, it makes most sense to use this view as it will produce the results required. If, in the future, biomedicine advances so that relativistic or quantuum representations are necessary, then current ontologies will need refactoring; even then, this future cost is likely to be offset by gains in the present.

notes/Q94600062.md: We used the IBM WDD, an online tool, to performqueries for major PNDs: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia,anxiety, depression, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’sdisease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. Weperformed two independent searches using WDD: one forgenes associated with PNDs (gene–PND) and another fordrugs associated with PNDs (drug–PND). WDD detectsassociations in original papers and reviews from PMCOpen Access (full text), Pubmed (abstracts), and patents.Relationships  are  detected  by  a  natural  language-processing algorithm when two entities of interest (gene,disease, or drug) are present in the same sentence of adocument and are connected through a verb or preposi-tion.  WDD  gives  relationships  a  confidence  score(0–100%) based on the number of documents supportingthe connection and on link meaningfulness. Only rela-tions with at least two documents of evidence and aconfidence score >50% were maintained in our study.

notes/Q28707570.md:Despite OBO Foundry efforts in promoting the creation of orthogonal ontologies, there is still a high rate of term reuse, with a recent study reporting 96% of Foundry candidate ontologies using terms from other ontologies [15]. The prevalence of term reuse and redundancy between ontologies leaves potential users asking the obvious question “which ontology do I use?”.
notes/Q28707570.md:The results from our ontology suitability analysis indicated that HPO would facilitate unique mapping of 30 GWAS phenotype descriptions during the partial mapping process. Manual inspection of these terms showed they were terms describing medical signs and symptoms, rather than disease names that have high coverage in the other ontologies investigated. For example, HPO can uniquely describe “Coronary artery calcification” (term identifier HP:0001717) rather than the disease for which this can be a clinical manifestation such as in “Gaucher Disease” (MeSH Descriptor identifier D005776). 
notes/Q28707570.md:We designed and created nanopublications (following the OpenPHACTS guidelines [51] where possible), related resources, and a query tool for RDF-based GWAS data in GWAS Central. To this end, we attempted to reuse ontol- ogies and to link to existing resources. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of a GWAS nanopublication and its connection to other external, semantically-enabled, resources. The entire nanopublication dataset, created from the primary GWAS Central relational database, has also been loaded into a triple-store. The triple-store can be queried through the GWAS Central SPARQL end-point. To execute a SPARQL query against the triple-store a researcher can either enter a query in the “GWAS Central SPARQL query form” page (accessible from the start page), or viathe APIbysending an HTTP GETorPOST request containing a ‘query’ parameter to the web service [http://fuseki.gwascentral.org/gc/query]
notes/Q28707570.md:nanopublications are simply items of data, not statements of knowledge. For example, a p-value for a marker in a GWAS represents a statistical test of association that was factually observed in an experiment. This p-value is clearly not equivalent to a validated biological causal rela- tionship between a genetic variant and a disease.
notes/Q28598176.md:Conventional  wisdom  suggests  that  biocuration  tasksrequire domain expertise; however, the results of both ex-periments reveal that when the task is structured as care-fully designed micro-tasks, it may be possible to leveragethe  labor  of  the  crowd  to  achieve  rapid  throughput  andcost-effective curation, especially by adding a layer of expert checking.

notes/Q35688096.md:open question is whether cell types form discrete clusters or whether gene expression forms a continuum of states. If such a continuum exists, what is its geometry? Recent theory on evolutionary trade-offs suggests that cells that need to per- form multiple tasks are arranged in a polygon or polyhedron (line, triangle, tetrahedron and so on, generally called polytopes) in gene expression space, whose vertices are the expres- sion profiles optimal for each task.
notes/Q35688096.md:We find cases in which single cells fill out a continuum of expression states within a polyhedron. This occurs in intestinal progenitor cells, which fill out a tetrahedron in gene expression space.
notes/Q35688096.md:The present results suggest that the concept of cell type may be expanded. In addition to discreet clusters in gene-expression space, we suggest a new possibility: a continuum of states within a polyhedron, in which the vertices represent specialists at key tasks.
notes/Q35688096.md:We find that cells are distributed inside polytopes, such as tetrahedrons or four-dimensional simplexes, with cells closest to each vertex responsible for a different key task.
notes/Q35688096.md:The geometry ofhow cells are distributed in gene expression space is an open question. One
notes/Q35688096.md:Some datasets fall into distinct clusters, with one cluster near each vertex, and thus support a picture of distinct and well-separated cell types. Other contexts, such as intestinal progenitor cells and spleen dendritic cells, show a continuum ofgene expres- sion states which uniformly fills the tetrahedron, supporting a picture ofa continuous range of cell states that carry out mixtures ofthe biological functions defined by the vertices. These find- ings expand the concept of cell type, by demonstrating the possibility ofa polyhedral contin- uum ofexpression states: cells can range between being task specialists near the vertices ofthe polyhedron, and generalists suitable for multiple tasks near the center.
notes/Q35688096.md:It is interesting to ask when is it better to design distinct cell types with separated biological
notes/Q35688096.md:Similarly, the continuum observed between intestinal progenitors, nodal cells and entero-
notes/Q35688096.md:cytes (Figs 2c and 5b) suggests a gradual differentiation process, with the nodal cells—a new class of cells defined in the present study—possibly an intermediate station between progenitors and enterocytes.
notes/Q35688096.md:More generally, this study indicates that the concept of cell type may be expanded. In addition to separated clusters in gene-expression space, we suggest a new possibility: a continuum of states within a polyhedron, in which the vertices represent specialists at key tasks, with generalist cells lying in the middle.
notes/Q35688096.md:Interesting framework, and a model that fits scRNA-seq data. The question that remains is how this would be integrated to the ways biologists handle knowledge. It seems a nice way to understand how cells fit to types, but difficult to use this for, for example, create models to study drug response, for example.

notes/Q92104055.md: Logical models have long been used to answer a variety of questions regarding the dynamical behaviours of regulatory networks. As the number of published logical models increases, there is a pressing need for systematic model annotation, referencing and curation in community-supported and standardised formats. This article summarises the key topics and future directions of a meeting entitled ‘Annotation and curation of computational models in biology’,
notes/Q92104055.md: Based on these discussions, four interdependent milestones were identified for the roadmap to CALMs in biology (Figure 2).
notes/Q98162195.md:Intriguingly,  dissociated  nasal  cells  appeared  larger.  There  was  a  proximo-distal  gradient  of cell size, with the largest average size in the nose (12.56 μm ± 0.71) and the smallest size in the distal airways (8.77 μm ± 0.71) (Figure E10E). This difference correlated with the number of detected genes and UMIs (Figures E2A and E2B).
notes/Q98162195.md: This result supports our previous  description  of  goblet  cells  as  precursors  of  multiciliated  cells  in  homeostatic  and healthy  epithelium  and  additionally  suggests  that  transition  through  this  stage  may  have slightly distinct dynamics between nasal and tracheobronchial epithelia (12
notes/Q98162195.md:. However, this did not prevent us from defining stable core cell type signatures for each epithelial, stromal and immune cell types, irrespective of their anatomical location. In contrast, important variations of gene expression were found when comparing  the  same  populations  of  suprabasal,  secretory  and  multiciliated  cells  from  the surface epithelium between nasal and tracheobronchial compartments. These results fit well with  previous  work  reporting  differential  gene  expression  signatures  between  nasal  and bronchial  brushings  (5,  35).  Interestingly, SIX3, PAX6-7,  and OTX1/2,
notes/Q98162195.md:A  focus  on  secretory  cells  demonstrates  that  nasal  cells  contain  few SCGB1A1+-  and SCGB3A1+- cells. Despite this low secretoglobin content, they display the core gene signature of  secretory  cells,  suggesting  that  secretoglobins  may  not  be  sufficient  marker  genes  to identify all secretory/club cells. These differences are important to consider when using nasal samplings as a proxy to assess bronchial status.

Beyond similarities in overall diversity and hierarchical organization, most cell types mapped at the subclass level, seven cell types mapped one-to-one, and no major classes had missing homologous types despite the last common ancestor between humans and mice living at least 65 million years ago51 and despite the thousand-fold difference in brain size and number of cells. Therefore, the transcriptomic organization of cell classes and subclasses appears conserved, with species and regional variation found at the finest level of cell-type distinction

Theyalso expressed many markers of tanycytes of the third ventricle,includingNes,Vim,Rax, andGpr50(Miranda-Angulo et al.,2014), but their location in the dorsal midbrain suggests thatthey instead represented a tanycyte of the circumventricularorgans (Kettenmann and Ransom, 2013).
notes/Q58793343.md:Second, some—but only some—cell classes show area-spe-cific patterns of gene expression that likely reflect their develop-mental history. This trend was strongest among neurons, astro-cytes, and ependymal cells; by contrast, oligodendrocytes,vascular cells, and immune cells exhibited similar gene expres-sion patterns across brain regions.

(2)Whycare about duplicates? We asked practitioners what impactduplicates have. (3)Howto manage duplicates? We askedpractitioners whether and how duplicates should be resolved.The details of questions and their possible responses are pro-vided below
notes/Q21092584.md:As both Editor-in-Chief of PLoS Computational Biology and Codirector of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), one of the oldest and widely used data resources in molecular biology, the question is particularly pertinent. Here, I give my perspective on what could and, I believe, should happen in the future.
notes/Q54670808.md:A secondary aim of this paper is to provide a discussion point between the bioinformatics and Semantic Web community. For the bioinformatics community, this paper shows how the nanopublication and semantic integration approach is critical for answering state-of-the art questions. For the Semantic Web community, this paper encourages continued investigation into managing biologically relevant annotations in a high-speed and usable way. In particular, we show how named graphs are central to answering questions in this domain.
notes/Q54670808.md:The assertion graph includes the protein, tissue, and the quality of the expression result (positive, negative), whereas the provenance graph includes the method of detection, the curation assessment, and the data used to make the assertion. In neXtProt, expression data are associated with qualitative quality of expression (weak, moderate, strong, etc.), as well as ‘not detected’ when a tissue or cell type had been tested and gave negative results.
notes/Q54670808.md:With the aim to show a sample of the questions that can currently be asked of our nanopublication implementation, we are presenting example queries that answer three biologically interesting use cases: 4.1.

notes/Q54670808.md:s. Even with the avail- ability of ontology repositories such as Bioportal [61] or the OBO foundry [62], we encountered many challenges in locating and eventually choosing the appropriate RDF properties and resources to model the data to correctly represent the notions expressed in the assertions. Often seemingly appropriate concepts were found although with subsequent extensive investigation of the domains, ranges, definitions, parents and children, they were rejected due to small disqualifying aspects of these details. However, solutions are appearing such as the community owned vocabulary system ConceptWiki [63], which allows the creation of concept-URL com- binations to be used and shared in the nanopublication modeling.
notes/Q56655129.md: Data are the lifeblood of research,and their value often do not end with the original study,as they can be reused for further investigation if properlyhandled.

notes/Q60137015.md:AMONG present-day biologists there 1s widespread interest in, and considerable disagreement on, the proper relationship between taxonomy* and other branches of their science, especially genetics, cytology and ecology
notes/Q60137015.md:In its simplest terms, classification consists in grouping individual objects (and, ultimately, sense data, expressed as qualities and relations) into classes, so that all the individuals in one class have certain attributes in common.
notes/Q60137015.md:Any exact definitions of the categories within this classification are, in my opinion, an impossibility. The categories, genus,.species, etc., are of the same nature as such categories as herd or heap, indi- vidual characters taking the place of individual animals or stones. A well-known trick in logic known as the 'sorites' illustrates this point. The question is put " Does one stone form a heap ?" If the respondent answer "No", it is asked, "Do two stones form a heap ?" and so on. Great difficulty is found in deciding when the addition of one stone constitutes a heap. The answer would vary from person to person and also according to the shape and size of the stones. Similarly, in a natural classification, the definition of the cate- gories must vary somewhat according to the mentality of individual biologists and the nature of the material being classified.
notes/Q60137015.md:Many other classifications based on data provided by genetics, cytology and ecology have been proposed during this century•, but these have for the most part either redefined the categories of traditional taxonomy in such a way as to destroy their general usefulness, or have employed mixed attributes as a basis for new categories

notes/Q91776830.md:A fundamental question in virology is why the infection of one cell results in extensive lytic virus replication whereas the infection of a second cell does not. At 2 h.p.i., CMV infection in most cells has already progressed from the ‘immediate-early’ (restricted to a few genes) to the ‘early’ phase of infection, in which most viral genes are already transcribed. Although most viral transcripts in all cells were new, we also observed substantial amounts of old RNAs of some viral genes (Extended Data Fig. 4). This represents virion-associated RNA that is delivered to the infected cell by the incoming virus particles
notes/Q54370168.md:All of these developments have helped to extend the usefulness of cell lines as reagents in laboratories, and we have recently estimated (unpublished results) that there is a total of;2 million publications that make use of cell lines.
notes/Q54370168.md:Unfortunately, as scientists in academia generally operate with a limited budget, they will rarely buy certified stocks of cell lines. Instead, they obtain a cell line from the nearest colleague who is already using it, thus greatly increasing the risk that what they are using is not what they expect to be using. Furthermore, whereas the methodology to authen- ticate cell lines exists, scientists rarely do so, also for reasons of cost but also because they are often not aware of the severity of this problem.
notes/Q54370168.md:Many specialized cell-line databases have been established over the years that cater to a specific taxonomic range or a category of cell lines. Most of these resources are unfortunately no longer maintained and/or available.
notes/Q54370168.md:it is an especially acute problem for curated, knowledge resources, such as the Cellosaurus, whose staff needs to peruse a high number ofscientific publications yet does not have the budget to pay the publishers’ article fees. This situation is especially frustrating when one realizes that knowledgebases are providing links back to publications and are, in effect, increasing the traffic toward publisher sites. Thus, in the context ofthe establishment ofthe Cellosaurus, it was necessary to use a variety ofnonstandard approaches to access the full-text version ofpapers behind paywalls
notes/Q54370168.md:Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org) is a free and collabo- ratively edited knowledge base hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. The life-science community is interested63 in using this platform as a structured, semantic web-compatible integration hub for biologic and medical data.

notes/Q93189154.md:One example of well-aligned retinal classification schemes are Bipolar cells (BCs) of the mouse retina. Studies using functional, morphological or genetic criteria converge onto the same number of 14 bipolar cell types. There are 3 different type 5 BC ‘versions’ (types 5t, 5o and 5i). Interestingly, both morphologically and genetically, the type 5 BCs are very close together.
notes/Q93189154.md:For us, these results suggest that the circuit context of these cells lead to important functional differences that one would want to recognize in a functional classification scheme. Recently, several large-scale classifications have been published, and many recent datasets now include much larger populations of retinal cells than before.
notes/Q93189154.md:In our view, an ideal classification approach may require utilizing a set of classification criteria depending on the hypothesis in question.
notes/Q93189154.md:The final point of "In our view, an ideal classification approach may require utilizing a set of classification criteria depending on the hypothesis in question ." is quite the same of mine. 
notes/Q48839876.md:Unlike discovery, which has the nature of an event, demonstration has the nature of a process. A claim that a certain cell grouping constitutes a type may be initially tentative and weak, but may gain in strength with further investigation. The process of demonstration may go on for some time, and many investigators may contribute to it.
notes/Q48839876.md:The claim for a new type may rest initially on little more than the implied assertion that if the reader were to study comparable data for a comparable period of time then they too would agree that a certain cell group constitutes a distinguishable type.
notes/Q48839876.md:In the first section, we attempt to develop the notion of a ‘natural cell type’; such types have an objective reality in that they originate in the species that is studied rath? er than in the mind of the investigator.
notes/Q48839876.md:In the second section, we discuss the issues that arise when one attempts to classi? fy cell types; that is to collect these types into various groupings. We again impose the constraint that such groupings be en? tirely empirical. A method is developed, based upon what we term ‘Whewell affini? ties’, for empirically testing whether cer? tain groupings are ‘natural
notes/Q48839876.md:A ‘natural type’ is one presumed to exist in nature, which has a reality independent of its investigation. Natural types are, therefore, discovered and demonstrated rather than defined.

Since the correspondence between electro- physiological and morphological findings is a hypothesis, currently acquiring confir? mation, we are not suggesting that these terms be used interchangeably at present. But just as ‘spinal motoneuron’ has be? come the common term used both physio? logically and anatomically, so too should the different types of ganglion cells acquire common names, irrespective of the method of investigation.
notes/Q48839876.md:The next question is whether there exist between types a 'natural affinity’ that is in some way unique, so that a grouping of these types would constitute a biological fact ra? ther than a convention. Any grouping of ganglion-cell types is, in effect, a classifi? cation scheme for the set of types.
notes/Q48839876.md:among living cats, splitters have estab? lished as many as 28 distinct genera, while lumpers make do with only one [Simpson, 1961]. It is not that these systematists necessarily differ on factual matters, and may all agree as to the form of the phylo? genetic tree; rather they differ on issues such as the point at which twigs become branches on this tree
notes/Q48839876.md:If the differentiation of ganglion cells occurs by a series of steps that successively narrows the range of types to which the ganglion cell can become a member, then the tree? like structure of these sequential steps could provide a useful empirical con? straint on the classification of ganglion cells. But this possibility has only theoreti? cal interest at present, since we know no? thing of the genetic expression of type.
notes/Q48839876.md:We do not mean to suggest the old and outdated notion that a ‘genus’ somehow contains the ‘essence’ of the form, or in some way expresses the ‘general form’ (i.e. as in the ‘generic/specific’ distinction).
notes/Q48839876.md:The question at issue here is not whether ganglion cells in general are homolo? gous, both within and across vertebrate species, but whether homologues can be found across species between specific ganglion-cell types or genera.
notes/Q48839876.md:The criteria for establishing homologies are simi? lar to those employed to establish phylogeny, and both remain difficult and unresolved problems in bi? ology. The issue here is whether there exists, even in principle, a method able to demonstrate homologies. As noted above, there appears to be a close relation between the phylogenetic criteria and Whewell’s maxim, and this appears to extend to homologic criteria as well.

notes/Q104794656.md:d. Tyser et al. used a combination of transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic lineage–labeling approaches to profile the molecular identity and precise locations of cells involved in the formation of the mouse embryonic heart. This approach allowed them to identify the earliest known progenitor of the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, which is an important source of signals and cells during cardiac development and injury.
notes/Q104794656.md:This enabled us to transcriptionally define the cardiac progenitor populations in this region, including FHF and SHF. As a user-friendly community resource, we created a web interface to investigate these data, accessible at https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/heartAtlas/.

notes/Q106642644.md:We next sought to establish the relationship between neuroblastoma cells and human fetal medullary development. We generated single-cell mRNA readouts from 21 fresh neuroblastoma specimens from two different centers using two platforms (Chromium 10x and CEL-Seq2).
notes/Q106642644.md:Neuroblastomas that arose outside the adrenal gland also exhibited sympathoblast signals (Fig. 3B). The sympathoblast signal was present across the principal risk groups of neuroblastoma, suggesting that it transcends the clinical diversity of neuroblastoma (Fig. 3C).
notes/Q106642644.md:Overall, our findings reveal an unexpected homogeneity in the cellular identity of neuroblastoma. Although future, larger-scale analyses may define the nuances of this signal and perhaps identify rare cancer cell types, our study would suggest that the principal normal cell correlate of neuroblastoma is the human fetal sympathoblast.

The NCBO annotator makes it possible to semantically annotate text by recognizing the entities and establishing a link to an ontology. When doing ontology-based indexing, one might use these annotations to ’bring together’ the data elements from different resources. The NCBO Annotator is based on Mgrep; it recognises and associates expressions in the text with unique concepts from biomedical ontologies. The NCBO Annotator utilizes to its advantage the hierarchy in the vocabularies used for the association.
notes/Q100560109.md:We show that alveolar capillaries are mosaics; similar to the epithelium that lines the alveolus, the alveolar endothelium is made up of two intermingled cell types, with complex ‘Swiss-cheese’- like morphologies and distinct functions. The first cell type, which we term the ‘aerocyte’, is specialized for gas exchange and the trafficking of leukocytes, and is unique to the lung. The other cell type, termed gCap (‘general’ capillary), is specialized to regulate vasomotor tone, and functions as a stem/progenitor cell in capillary homeostasis and repair. The two cell types develop from bipotent progenitors, mature gradually and are affected differently in disease and during ageing. This cell-type specialization is conserved between mouse and human lungs but is not found in alligator or turtle lungs, suggesting it arose during the evolution of the mammalian lung.
notes/Q100560109.md:To test whether the capillary populations are stable cell types or interconverting cell states, we used complementary genetic strategies to permanently label each subset (using either Apln-creER or Aplnr-creER) and analysed the expression of subset markers in labelled cells after 48 hours, 1 month or 6 months to determine whether the labelled popu- lation continues to express the markers, or whether cells turn them off and start to express markers of the other population. We found minimal (0.2% at 6 months) interconversion (Fig. 1h, i, Extended Data Fig. 1k–n), indicating that the populations are not transient cell states. We conclude that the alveolar capillary network is composed of two intermingled, stable cell types, which we call gCap (general capillary cells) and aCap (aerocytes; see below).
notes/Q100560109.md:We found only a small num- ber of genes (Scn7a, Mapt) that were expressed by all (or most), and only, alveolar capillary cells, suggesting that few if any molecular func- tions are carried out by both capillary cell types but not by other lung endothelial cells
notes/Q100560109.md:--> Nice taxon restriction testing. But how is the archetype defined?
notes/Q100560109.md:Our analysis suggests that some cell-type-specific functions are
notes/Q100560109.md:conserved between mice and humans. For example, specialized leukocyte-trafficking genes are restricted to aerocytes, and gCap cells may regulate vasomotor tone in both species (Fig. 4m, Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). But capillary cell types can also gain (or lose) functions: in mice, gCap cells preferentially express MHC class II genes, whereas in humans, these genes are expressed by aerocytes (Fig. 4o, Extended Data Fig. 10a, b, e).
notes/Q104475823.md:EBE aims to support predictions concerning how an evidence-based intervention will perform in a new educational setting indirectly by establishing effectiveness generalizations.

notes/Q50735370.md:‘The aim of orthodox taxonomy is to yield taxonomic groups which bring together organisms with the highest proportion of similar attributes. This is the logical basis of what we somewhat loosely call ‘natural’ taxa, for it enables us to make the greatest number of generalizations about the organ- isms which are grouped inte one taxon'-?,
notes/Q50735370.md:The earher dictum that taxa should be mono- phyletic groups is no longer strictly observed, as, for example, in the class Mammalia®*, which represent an essentially phenetic taxon. We believe that most phenetic taxa will also be monophyletic, but would uot be concerned if they were not. Suppose an absurdly extreme overall convergence had occurred so that two forras were almnost indistinguishable and could readily and successfully hybridize: what is the purpose of separating them on prounds of ancestry when in all other attributes they are virtually the same ?

notes/Q106692362.md:Here we show that expression of an osteogenic growth factor, osteolectin13,14, distinguishes peri-arteriolar LEPR+ cells poised to undergo osteogenesis from peri-sinusoidal LEPR+ cells poised to undergo adipogenesis (but retaining osteogenic potential). Peri-arteriolar LEPR+osteolectin+ cells are rapidly dividing, short-lived osteogenic progenitors that increase in number after fracture and are depleted during ageing. Deletion of Scf from adult osteolectin+ cells did not affect the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells or most restricted progenitors but depleted common lymphoid progenitors, impairing lymphopoiesis

notes/Q52625486.md:One of the key recommendations was to establish a standard strategy for defining cell type classes that combine three essential components:
notes/Q52625486.md:We are now establishing an extension ontology module containing provisional definitions for novel cell types that we and other research groups will contribute. In this way we will ensure the integrity of the CL reference, while still allowing for the rapid expansion of its content to accommodate cell types defined via these new technologies.
notes/Q52625486.md:For biomedical ontologies to stay relevant, it will be critical for ontology developers to establish procedures for the processing and incorporation of representations derived from these data-intensive technologies into reference ontologies in a timely fashion. 
notes/Q91614095.md:We used a large set of such gating definitions and corresponding cell types submitted by different investigators into ImmPort, a central database for immunology studies, to examine the ability to parse gating definitions using terms from the Protein Ontology (PRO) and cell type descriptions, using the Cell Ontology (CL)We then used logical axioms from CL to detect discrepancies between the two.
notes/Q91614095.md:We also suggest a number of new terms to describe gating definitions in flow cytometry that are not based on molecular markers captured in PRO, but on forward- and side-scatter of light during data acquisition, which is more appropriate to capture in the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). Finally, our approach results in suggestions on what logical axioms and new cell types could be considered for addition to the Cell Ontology.
notes/Q91614095.md:While the synonyms in Table 1 were considered not problematic, we also found a number of labels that could not be mapped precisely to individual proteins in PRO. A common case were protein complexes: Investigators often refer to “CD8”, which is a complex of a CD8 alpha
notes/Q91614095.md:Several gating definitions we encountered for flow cytometry data do not refer to a specific marker, but rather utilize forward- and side-scatter of detector light to provide size estimates of the object passing by the detector.
notes/Q91614095.md:Such definitions of cell types based on their characteristics in a flow cytometer are best captured in the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI), and we are in the process of submitting them there.

notes/Q37656899.md:The often subjective and arbitrary naming of neurons led to a cluttered literature landscape in which breakdowns in communication can hinder the understanding of the struc- ture and function of the brain. A comprehensive solution would require establishing a broadly applicable and widely accepted classification scheme defining neuron types based on their properties.
notes/Q37656899.md:A recent empirical assessment of inter-investigator
notes/Q37656899.md:When neurons are described in a publication, they are typically named in isolation, out of context with respect to the rest of the brain circuit and the literature. Sometimes neuron types or individual neurons are indicated solely by a non-descriptive label (e.g., ‘‘Type I’’ cells [12] or ‘‘cell #7’’ [13], and occasionally they are not named at all.
notes/Q37656899.md:Converting information published for human consumption into machine-readable form dictates system level decisions to minimize the energy cost of processing. We chose a three-step workflow. The first step is for researchers (doctoral students, postdocs, and faculty) to identify and study relevant articles, gleaning salient information and encoding it into spreadsheets. The second step involves python code to ingest these spreadsheets into data tables, populating along the way relation tables. The third step consists of rendering the resulting structured data in web pages dynamically leveraging the database.

notes/Q47406275.md: We used IBM  Watson® to sieve through all RBPs in the genome and identify new RBPs linked to ALS (ALS-RBPs). IBM Watson extracted features from pub-lished literature to create semantic similarities and identify new connections between entities of interest. IBM Watson analyzed all published abstracts of previously known ALS-RBPs, and applied that text-based knowledge to all RBPs in the genome, ranking them by semantic similarity to the known set.
notes/Q47406275.md: o test the model generation by Watson, we first performed a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation to demonstrate the predictive power of Watson using the 11 known ALS-linked RBPs. To do so, the graph diffusion algorithm was applied 11 times based on the same distance matrix, but each time a different known RBP was taken out of the positive set and placed into the candidate set
notes/Q47406275.md:If we make a very conservative estimate and assume that 20% of all RBPs (293 out of 1467) are altered, then the significance of the Watson predictions is p = 7.21 × 10−5. Therefore, the probability that Watson randomly selected RBPs and correctly predicted eight of the top ten by chance is quite low.

All identi-fiers, regardless of scheme, are resolved by a user agent if they are embedded in a URL. As for institutions that have long-term access in their mission, many people think that smaller, newer institutions’ website hostnames will be short-lived compared to those of older, larger institutions (e.g., loc.gov, bnf.fr). Some people prefer to trust a hostname backed by a group of institutions, even if comparatively young (e.g., dx.doi.org), rather than by any one institution. Among such group or consortial arrangements, some peo-ple prefer to trust those committed to open access (e.g., gbif.org). Persistence missions can  also  far  exceed  current  technological  solutions.  Will,  for  example,  current  http  protocols look anything like the protocols used in 2065? Forecasting about resolver persistence for 10, 20, 50, or 100 years is at best educated guesswork, but it should take  into  account  such  things  as  inevitable  technological  advances,  resolver  or-ganization’s mission, size, business model, openness, and current age.

notes/Q94503935.md:The mnnCorrect and fastMNN functions of the batchelor R package determine anchors taking advantage of mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) cells, i.e. identifying pairs of cells that are mutually closest to each other across batches
notes/Q94503935.md:. The majority of these methods exploit algorithms commonly adopted in multi-view machine learning and build on sophisticated techniques for dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, graph analysis, maximum likelihood estimation and statistical modeling. In most applications, the integrative analysis is approached in an unsupervised manner to identify cell types shared by different datasets or previously unknown correlations between modalities. In some other cases, the integration is conducted supervising the transfer of information from one dataset to another (as in cell label transfer from well-annotated atlases) or across different layers (as in the joint analysis of transcriptional and spatial expression).
notes/Q46412887.md:Closer inspection, however, reveals that these approaches are mostly not about publishing semantic representations, as the name seems to suggest. Rather, they take the processes and outcomes of the current narrative-based publishing system for granted and only work with already published papers. This includes approaches involving semantic annotations, semantic interlinking, semantic integration, and semantic discovery, but with the semantics coming into play only after the publication of the original article. While these are interesting and important approaches, they fall short of providing a vision to transcend the current publishing paradigm. We argue here for taking the term semantic publishing literally and work towards a vision of genuine semantic publishing.
notes/Q46412887.md:Structured Digital Abstracts [11,43], having been first proposed ten years ago, are probably the oldest approach of this kind. Their basic idea is to require for articles to come with a machine-interpretable summary of the main claims, besides the classical abstract for human readers. They proposed to let authors themselves capture the claims of their own scientific contributions, such as a newly discovered protein-protein interaction, in a notation with formal semantics.

However, we believe that it is always possible to build a formal representation of the main content at the highest level, such as introducing and advocating a new concept, even though we will mostly not be able to provide a complete formal definition. In this sense, such a representation is underspecified but has essential coverage.

notes/Q52160105.md:HighLife: Higher-arity Fact Harvesting
notes/Q52160105.md:Text-based knowledge extraction methods for populating knowl-edge bases have focused on binary facts: relationships between twoentities. However, in advanced domains such as health, it is oftencrucial to consider ternary and higher-arity relations. An exam-ple is to capture which drug is used for which disease at whichdosage (e.g. 2.5 mg/day) for which kinds of patients (e.g., childrenvs. adults). In this work, we present an approach to harvest higher-arity facts from textual sources.
notes/Q52160105.md:The largest publicly available KBs are babelnet.org, dbpedia.org, wikidata.org and yago-knowledge.org.They contain many millions of entities and billions of facts
notes/Q52160105.md:We are ableto harvest higher-arity relations by utilizing more complex patternrepresentations, i.e. trees instead of pure sequence patterns, and byconsidering partial facts, i.e. facts with unknown arguments.
notes/Q52160105.md:nowledge Bases:Contrary to knowledge bases, such as YAGO [18],WikiData [48] and Freebase, which extract n-ary facts from pre-structured resources (e.g. Wikipedia Infoboxes) or rely on humaninput, we focus on harvesting n-ary facts from text.
notes/Q52160105.md:The goal of the HighLife system is to harvest n-ary facts from textcorpora. One key feature is composing higher-arity facts from par-tial observations by joining arguments, e.g. one sentence referringto a drug, a disease and a target group and another one referring tothe same drug, same target group, a dosage but not the disease arejoined into a single fact containing all 4 pieces of information

notes/Q42084918.md:Related question remains poorly defined: what is a ‘cell type’? In other words, by what criteria should we categorize cells into classes?
notes/Q42084918.md:Answering this question is not a mere academic exercise but has deep implications for both developmental biology and for engineering cell fate.
notes/Q52655768.md:ere we analyse more than 2,300 single cells in the developing human prefrontal cortex from gestational weeks 8 to 26 using RNA sequencing. We identify 35 subtypes of cells in six main classes and trace the developmental trajectories of these cells. Detailed analysis of neural progenitor cells highlights new marker genes and unique developmental features of intermediate progenitor cells.
notes/Q52655768.md:The prefrontal cortex (PFC) covers the front of the frontal lobe of the brain in mammals and has important roles in memory, emotion, cognitive behaviour, decision-making and social behaviour1–4.   To   analyse the molecular features of cells in the PFC during human brain development, we obtained 2,309 single cells from human embryonic PFCs at gestational week

notes/Q101051363.md:--> Interesting that they call it a "population" and not a cell type. The combination with present tense ("controls") illustrates that the intended meaning is not descriptive, but generalizative.
notes/Q57339063.md:let us assume that we conduct an analysis using, say, 1,000 individual data entries from each of three very large datasets (containing, say, millions ofdata entries each). How can we now refer to exactly these 3,000 entries to justify whatever conclusion we draw from them? The best thing we can currently do is to republish these 3,000 data entries as a new dataset and to refer to the large datasets as their origin. Apart from the practical disadvantages of being forced to republish data just to refer to subsets of larger datasets, other scientists need to either (blindly) trust us or go through the tedious process of semi-automatically verifying each of these entries
notes/Q57339063.md:We proposed a controlled natural language (Kuhn, 2014) for these informal statements, which we called AIDA (standing for the introduced restriction on English sentences to be atomic, independent, declarative, and absolute), and we had shown before that controlled natural language can also serve in the fully formalized case as a user-friendly syntax for representing scientific facts (Kuhn et al., 2006).

notes/Q57001498.md: Although it remains aspirational, the synthesis of computational simulation with knowledge-based generation and refinement of hypotheses has received substantial interest from funding agencies.
notes/Q57001498.md: Another im- portant understudied question is how to represent what is not known: any scientist can describe gaps, ambiguities and uncertainties in existing knowledge, yet there are few computational methods capable of representing, let alone reasoning about, such ignorance.
notes/Q57001498.md: Is it possible for computational systems to generate significant and novel mechanistic and pathomechanistic hypotheses about open questions in biomedicine? It is positive answers to questions like these that will drive knowledge-based data science into the mainstream of biomedical research.

notes/Q35670188.md:This review aims to cover the essential features of bio-ontologies, a relatively new area ofbioinformatics. It deals only briefly with the formal study ofontologies in com- puter science, as this is an established and well-documented field.
notes/Q35670188.md:First, its conceptual framework required an analysis of the contexts in which cells are used and described (morphology, function, species,and so on) and the sorts ofrelationships required (is-a and is-derived- from). Second, in attempting to make it useful for all organisms, ubiquitous cell types are at a much higher level in the hierarchy than those restricted to specific families oforganisms. Third, it required the garnering of data from a range of standard textbooks. Fourth, it involved people from widely different fields freely giving expert knowledge:Michael Ashburner and J.B.L.B. initi- ated the ontology and provided invertebrate and verte- brate data, whereas David States and S.Y.R. provided blood-cell and plant data, respectively. The prototype ontology is now publicly available for comment and is being improved by the community. In the end, the ontology will reflect the expertise ofthe community that uses it rather than that ofany individual and it will be available for anyone who wishes to code cell-type identities in a standard way.
notes/Q35670188.md:Mechanisms for sharing the development with those in the field — including establishing a forum for those interested in similar areas ofontology development and soliciting or incorporating feedback from individual researchers — will facilitate public ownership. Public support is just as important for maintenance ofontolo- gies as it is for databases. This will only happen if ontologies are actively curated and this, ofcourse, is the solution to the second problem.
notes/Q33786317.md:Some ambiguities resulted from how a cell type is defined in the scientific literature. The automated reasoning for the “mature NKTcell” provided an interesting example. Reasoning over the ontology failed to infer an is_a relationship between “NK T cell” and the “natural killer cell” despite “NK T cell” having the synonym “natural killer T cell” (not shown). Investigation of the literature revealed that the name “natural killer T cell” is controversial; the origin of the name “NK T” cell refers to cell surface expression of the NK1.1 protein and was not intended to imply a direct link to natural killer cells [21]. However some researchers feel there is enough functional overlap between “NK-” and “NK T-” cell types to justify the “natural killer T cell” moniker [21]. In Hemo_CL, the synonym is left in place as it reflects common usage, but NK T cell types and natural killer cell types are kept in separate branches of the ontology as inferred by the reasoner.

notes/Q91908361.md:We will briefly introduce some notions from dynamical systems theory, and discuss how they offer a framework within which to build a rigorous understanding of what we mean by a cell “fate”, and how cells change fate. We will also outline how modern experiments, particu- larly high-throughput single-cell experiments, are enabling us to test and explore the limits of these ideas, and build a better understanding of cellular identities.
notes/Q91908361.md:primarily single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) which have revealed substantial “heterogeneity” within previously established cell types
notes/Q91908361.md:Increasingly it is becoming clear that traditional ways of identifying and categorizing cell types are unable to capture this complexity, leading to ambiguity as to what is really meant by a cell type. A rigorous, consistent definition of cell type, is therefore required to make use of this new wave of gene expression data. By developing such a theory, we can begin to address the question of why patterns of expression, and not some others, occur; or why particular patterns of expression should confer particular functions to the cell.
notes/Q91908361.md:Mathematical models provide a logical frame- work within which to explore complex issues like this, and there has accordingly been a long and fruitful history of biologists and theoreticians working together to explore this issue theoretically, and wrestling with how mathematical notions relate to the complexity observed in experiment.
notes/Q91908361.md:To begin our discussion, it is useful to distinguish between the state of a cell and its fate.Beforewestart it is worthnotingthat the terms cell “type” and cell “fate” are often used interchangeably. As a technicality, however, fate refers to the future of the cell—the “type” toward which it is progressing. For reasons that will become apparent, we will focus on cell fates specifically.
notes/Q91908361.md:Traditionally, there were thought to be 200–300 distinct cell fates in the adult human (Junqueira, Junqueira, Carneiro, & Kelley, 1992) (although by uncovering hitherto unappreciated heterogeneity within established cell types recent efforts, such as the Human Cell Atlas, are revising this estimate (Lukowski et al., 2019; Regev et al. (2017))

notes/Q91908361.md:many experiments investi- gate cell populations as they transition from one fate to another. Because they probe the transition between fates, such dynamics are out-of-equilibrium.
notes/Q104450595.md:We developed Tangram, an algorithm that uses sc/snRNA-seqas “puzzle pieces” to align in space to  match  “the  shape”  of  the  spatial  data(Fig.  1a).The  input to  Tangram  is  sc/snRNA-seq  dataalong with spatial data from the same regionor tissue type, from any currently available spatial method(e.g.,  MERFISH,  smFISH,  STARmap,  ISH, or Visium),  requiring  only  that  the two modalities share at least some subset of common genes.Intuitively, Tangram first randomly placesthe sc/snRNA-seq profilesin space, then computes an objective function that mimics the spatial correlation  between  each  gene  in  the  sc/snRNA-seq  dataand  in  the  spatial  data.
notes/Q56550183.md:Testing of the 27 MCF7 strains against 321 anti-cancer compounds uncovered strikingly disparate drug response: at least 75% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origin and consequence of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.
notes/Q56550183.md:We performed extensive genomic characterization of 27 versions (hereafter called “strains”) of the commonly used estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell line MCF7.
notes/Q90025338.md:Crowdsourcing through paid microtask platforms to expand the training datasets has proven to have great potential, but questions regarding scalability prompted us to investigate citizen science as a potential avenue for crowdsourcing RE.
