This article explores how authors report on their results and how the collection of reported facts can be traced, compared and evaluated against each other. It gives early indications of what results might be produced if we applied automatic reasoning to the information from scientific literature and other resources.

Rzhetsky, A., Seringhaus, M. & Gerstein, M. Seeking a new biology through text mining. Cell 134, 9–13 (2008). The authors argue that the exploitation of the scientific literature will serve as an additional resource for the generation of hypotheses and the validation of human- driven hypotheses
